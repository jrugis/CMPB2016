	Abstract = {d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3, or IP3) is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates cytosolic Ca2+ activities ([Ca2+]i). To study this signaling branch in intact cells, we have synthesized a caged and cell permeable derivative of IP3, ci-IP3/PM, from myo-inositol in 9 steps. Ci-IP3/PM is a homologue of cm-IP3/PM, a caged and cell permeable IP3 ester developed earlier. In ci-IP3/PM, 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups of myo-inositiol are protected by an isopropylidene group; whereas in cm-IP3/PM, a methoxymethylene is used. Ci-IP3/PM can be loaded into cells non-invasively to high concentrations without activating IP3 receptors (IP3Rs). UV uncaging of loaded ci-IP3 released i-IP3, a potent agonist of IP3Rs, and evoked Ca2+ release from internal stores. Interestingly, elevations of [Ca2+]i by i-IP3 lasted longer than [Ca2+]i transients by m-IP3, the uncaging product of cm-IP3. To understand this difference, we measured the metabolic stability of i-IP3 and m-IP3. Like natural IP3 which is known to be rapidly metabolized in cells, m-IP3 could only be detected within several seconds after uncaging cm-IP3. In contrast, i-IP3 was metabolized at a much slower rate. By exploiting different metabolic rates of m-IP3 and i-IP3, we developed two procedures for activating IP3Rs in cells without UV uncaging. The first method involves photolyzing ci-IP3/PM in vitro to generate i-IP3/PM. Successive additions of low micromolar i-IP3/PM to NIH 3T3 cells caused graded Ca2+ releases, confirming that "quantal Ca2+ release" occurs in fully intact cells with normal ATP supplies and undisrupted endoplasmic reticulum. The second technique utilizes two photon uncaging. After locally illuminating cells loaded with cm-IP3 with femtosecond-pulsed near-infrared light (730 nm), we observed a burst of Ca2+ activity in the uncaging area. This local Ca2+ rise rapidly propagated across cells and could be repeated many times in different sub-cellular locations to produce artificial Ca2+ oscillations of defined amplitudes and frequencies. The complementary advantages of these IP3 prodrugs should provide new approaches for studying IP3-Ca2+ signaling in intact cell populations with high spatiotemporal resolutions.},

	Abstract = {KEY POINTS: Agonist-dependent oscillations in the concentration of free cytosolic calcium are a vital mechanism for the control of airway smooth muscle contraction and thus are a critical factor in airway hyper-responsiveness. Using a mathematical model, closely tied to experimental work, we show that the oscillations in membrane potential accompanying the calcium oscillations have no significant effect on the properties of the calcium oscillations. In addition, the model shows that calcium entry through store-operated calcium channels is critical for calcium oscillations, but calcium entry through voltage-gated channels has much less effect. The model predicts that voltage-gated channels are less important than store-operated channels in the control of airway smooth muscle tone.
ABSTRACT: Airway smooth muscle contraction is typically the key mechanism underlying airway hyper-responsiveness, and the strength of muscle contraction is determined by the frequency of oscillations of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+) ) concentration. In airway smooth muscle cells, these Ca(2+) oscillations are caused by cyclic Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, although Ca(2+) influx via plasma membrane channels is also necessary to sustain the oscillations over longer times. To assess the relative contributions of store-operated and voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels to this Ca(2+) influx, we generated a comprehensive mathematical model, based on experimental Ca(2+) measurements in mouse precision-cut lung slices, to simulate Ca(2+) oscillations and changes in membrane potential. Agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations are accompanied by oscillations in membrane potential, although the membrane potential oscillations are too small to generate large Ca(2+) currents through voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, and thus have little effect on the Ca(2+) oscillations. Ca(2+) entry through voltage-gated channels only becomes important when the cell is depolarized (e.g. by a high external K(+) concentration). As a result, agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations are critically dependent on Ca(2+) entry through store-operated channels but do not depend strongly on Ca(2+) entry though voltage-gated channels.},

	Abstract = {KEY POINTS: Tonic contractions of rabbit urethra are associated with spontaneous electrical slow waves that are thought to originate in pacemaker cells termed interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). ICC pacemaker activity results from their ability to generate propagating Ca(2+) waves, although the exact mechanisms of propagation are not understood. In this study, we have identified spontaneous localised Ca(2+) events for the first time in urethral ICC; these were due to Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and, while they often remained localised, they sometimes initiated propagating Ca(2+) waves. We show that propagation of Ca(2+) waves in urethral ICC is critically dependent upon Ca(2+) influx via reverse mode NCX. Our data provide a clearer understanding of the intracellular mechanisms involved in the generation of ICC pacemaker activity. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are putative pacemaker cells in the rabbit urethra. Pacemaker activity in ICC results from spontaneous propagating Ca(2+) waves that are modulated by [Ca(2+)]o and whose propagation is inhibited by inositol tri-phosphate receptor (IP3 R) blockers. The purpose of this study was to further examine the role of Ca(2+) influx and Ca(2+) release in the propagation of Ca(2+) waves. Intracellular Ca(2+) was measured in Fluo-4-loaded ICC using a Nipkow spinning disc confocal microscope at fast acquisition rates (50 fps). We identified previously undetected localised Ca(2+) events originating from ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Inhibiting Ca(2+) influx by removing [Ca(2+)]o or blocking reverse mode sodium-calcium exchange (NCX) with KB-R 7943 or SEA-0400 abolished Ca(2+) waves, while localised Ca(2+) events persisted. Stimulating RyRs with 1 mm caffeine restored propagation. Propagation was also inhibited when Ca(2+) release sites were uncoupled by buffering intracellular Ca(2+) with EGTA-AM. This was reversed when Ca(2+) influx via NCX was increased by reducing [Na(+)]o to 13 mm. Low [Na(+)]o also increased the frequency of Ca(2+) waves and this effect was blocked by tetracaine and ryanodine but not 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). RT-PCR revealed that isolated ICC expressed both RyR2 and RyR3 subtypes. We conclude: (i) RyRs are required for the initiation of Ca(2+) waves, but wave propagation normally depends on activation of IP3 Rs; (ii) under resting conditions, propagation by IP3 Rs requires sensitisation by influx of Ca(2+) via reverse mode NCX; (iii) propagation can be maintained by RyRs if they have been sensitised to Ca(2+).},

@article{pecze2015,
	Abstract = {Brief changes in the cytosolic and intra-organellar Ca2+ concentration serve as specific signals for various physiological processes. In mesothelial cells lining the surface of internal organs and the walls of body cavities, a re-entry in the cell cycle (G0-G1 transition) evoked by serum re-administration induces long-lasting Ca2+ oscillations with a slowly decreasing frequency. Individual mesothelial cells show a wide range of different oscillatory patterns within a single, supposedly homogenous cell population. Changes in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (ccyt) show baseline oscillatory patterns i.e., discrete Ca2+ transients starting from a constant basal ccyt level. The ER Ca2+ concentration (cER) displays a sawtooth wave at a semi-depleted ER state; the minimum level is reached just briefly after the maximal value for ccyt. These oscillations depend on plasmalemmal Ca2+ influx and on the inositol trisphosphate concentration [InsP3]; the Ca2+ influx is a crucial determinant of the oscillation frequency. Partial blocking of SERCA pumps modifies the oscillation frequency in both directions, i.e. increasing it in some cells and lowering it in others. Current mathematical models for Ca2+ oscillations mostly fail to reproduce two experimentally observed phenomena: the broad range of interspike intervals and constant basal ccyt levels between two Ca2+ spikes. Here we developed a new model based on--and fitted to--Ca2+ recordings of ccyt and cER recorded in primary mouse mesothelial cells. The model allowed for explaining many features of experimentally observed Ca2+ oscillations. We consider this model to be suitable to simulate various types of InsP3 receptor-based baseline Ca2+ oscillations.},

@article{sugawara1997,
	Abstract = {Stimulation of B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) induces a rapid increase in cytoplasmic free calcium due to its release from intracellular stores and influx from the extracellular environment. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are ligand-gated channels that release intracellular calcium stores in response to the second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Most hematopoietic cells, including B cells, express at least two of the three different types of IP3R. We demonstrate here that B cells in which a single type of IP3R has been deleted still mobilize calcium in response to BCR stimulation, whereas this calcium mobilization is abrogated in B cells lacking all three types of IP3R. Calcium mobilization by a transfected G protein-coupled receptor (muscarinic M1 receptor) was also abolished in only triple-deficient cells. Capacitative Ca2+ entry, stimulated by thapsigargin, remains unaffected by loss of all three types of IP3R. These data establish that IP3Rs are essential and functionally redundant mediators for both BCR- and muscarinic receptor-induced calcium mobilization, but not for thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx. We further show that the BCR-induced apoptosis is significantly inhibited by loss of all three types of IP3R, suggesting an important role for Ca2+ in the process of apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) releases calcium from intracellular stores and triggers complex waves and oscillations in levels of cytosolic free calcium. To determine which longer-term responses are controlled by oscillations in InsP3 and cytosolic free calcium, it would be useful to deliver exogenous InsP3, under spatial and temporal control, into populations of unpermeabilized cells. Here we report the 15-step synthesis of a membrane-permeant, caged InsP3 derivative from myo-inositol This derivative diffused into intact cells and was hydrolysed to produce a caged, metabolically stable InsP3 derivative. This latter derivative accumulated in the cytosol at concentrations of hundreds of micromolar, without activating the InsP3 receptor. Ultraviolet illumination uncaged an InsP3 analogue nearly as potent as real InsP3, and generated spikes of cytosolic free calcium, and stimulated gene expression via the nuclear factor of activated T cells. The same total amount of InsP3 analogue elicited much more gene expression when released by repetitive flashes at 1-minute intervals than when released at 0.5- or > or = 2-minute intervals, as a single pulse, or as a slow sustained plateau. Thus, oscillations in cytosolic free calcium levels at roughly physiological rates maximize gene expression for a given amount of InsP3.},

	Abstract = {Calcium ions play critical roles in neuronal development. Stimulation of transient elevations of intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) activates protein kinases, regulates transcription and influences motility and morphology. Embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons exhibit a Ca(2+)-sensitive period in culture; removing extracellular Ca2+ during this period affects several aspects of neuronal differentiation. However, both the mechanisms that generate natural fluctuations in Ca2+i and the signals they transduce are not well understood. Spontaneous, transient and repeated elevations of Ca2+i in embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons have been observed over periods up to 5 h in vitro and in vivo, confocally imaging fluo 3-loaded cells. Developing neurons generate two distinctive types of spontaneous Ca2+i transients, calcium spikes and calcium waves. We have investigated the mechanisms by which they are generated and their roles in directing neuronal differentiation. Spikes are generated by spontaneous action potentials, and thus are rapidly propagated throughout entire neurons. Ca2+ entry triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, and spikes have a characteristic double exponential decay. In contrast, the generation of waves does not involve conventional voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, but an unknown Ca2+ entry pathway that can be blocked by Ni2+ at a higher concentration than required to block classical voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Waves rise and decay slowly, and unlike spikes, are local events. However both spikes and waves are abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Developmentally, the incidence and frequency of spikes decrease while the incidence and frequency of waves are constant. To study the roles of Ca2+ transients, we have imaged Ca2+ in spinal neurons throughout an extended period of early development, and find that spikes and waves are expressed at distinct frequencies. Neuronal differentiation is altered when they are eliminated by preventing Ca2+ influx. By reimposing different frequency patterns of Ca2+ transients, we demonstrate that natural spike activity is sufficient to promote normal neurotransmitter expression and channel maturation, while wave activity at growth cones is sufficient to regulate neurite extension. On the other hand, suppression of spontaneous Ca2+ elevations with BAPTA, a rapid Ca2+ chelator, indicates that they are also necessary to direct differentiation. Ca2+ transients appear to encode information in their frequency. Thus, they act like action potentials, although they are 10(4) times longer in duration and less frequent and implement an intrinsic development program.},

We find that glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity is also Ca(2+)-dependent and parallels the appearance of GABA. We show that xGAD 67 transcripts first appear in the embryonic spinal cord during the period in which these Ca2+ spikes are generated, in a pattern that is temporally and spatially appropriate to account for differentiation of GABAergic interneurons. RNase protection and competitive quantitative RT-PCR demonstrate that transcript levels are approximately threefold greater when neurons are cultured in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ that permits generation of transients than when cultured in its absence. The frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ spikes plays a crucial role in the regulation of transcripts, since reimposition of Ca2+ transients at the frequency generated in cultured neurons rescues normal expression. We conclude that naturally occurring low frequencies of these Ca2+ transients regulate levels of xGAD 67 mRNA in differentiating neurons.},

@article{thurley2014,
	Abstract = {Ca(2+) is a ubiquitous intracellular messenger that regulates diverse cellular activities. Extracellular stimuli often evoke sequences of intracellular Ca(2+) spikes, and spike frequency may encode stimulus intensity. However, the timing of spikes within a cell is random because each interspike interval has a large stochastic component. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and rat primary hepatocytes, we found that the average interspike interval also varied between individual cells. To evaluate how individual cells reliably encoded stimuli when Ca(2+) spikes exhibited such unpredictability, we combined Ca(2+) imaging of single cells with mathematical analyses of the Ca(2+) spikes evoked by receptors that stimulate formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). This analysis revealed that signal-to-noise ratios were improved by slow recovery from feedback inhibition of Ca(2+) spiking operating at the whole-cell level and that they were robust against perturbations of the signaling pathway. Despite variability in the frequency of Ca(2+) spikes between cells, steps in stimulus intensity caused the stochastic period of the interspike interval to change by the same factor in all cells. These fold changes reliably encoded changes in stimulus intensity, and they resulted in an exponential dependence of average interspike interval on stimulation strength. We conclude that Ca(2+) spikes enable reliable signaling in a cell population despite randomness and cell-to-cell variability, because global feedback reduces noise, and changes in stimulus intensity are represented by fold changes in the stochastic period of the interspike interval.},

	Abstract = {How Ca(2+) oscillations are generated and fine-tuned to yield versatile downstream responses remains to be elucidated. In hepatocytes, G protein-coupled receptor-linked Ca(2+) oscillations report signal strength via frequency, whereas Ca(2+) spike amplitude and wave velocity remain constant. IP3 uncaging also triggers oscillatory Ca(2+) release, but, in contrast to hormones, Ca(2+) spike amplitude, width, and wave velocity were dependent on [IP3] and were not perturbed by phospholipase C (PLC) inhibition. These data indicate that oscillations elicited by IP3 uncaging are driven by the biphasic regulation of the IP3 receptor by Ca(2+), and, unlike hormone-dependent responses, do not require PLC. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) did not perturb Ca(2+) oscillations elicited by IP3 uncaging, indicating that reloading of endoplasmic reticulum stores via plasma membrane Ca(2+) influx does not entrain the signal. Activation and inhibition of PKC attenuated hormone-induced Ca(2+) oscillations but had no effect on Ca(2+) increases induced by uncaging IP3. Importantly, PKC activation and inhibition differentially affected Ca(2+) spike frequencies and kinetics. PKC activation amplifies negative feedback loops at the level of G protein-coupled receptor PLC activity and/or IP3 metabolism to attenuate IP3 levels and suppress the generation of Ca(2+) oscillations. Inhibition of PKC relieves negative feedback regulation of IP3 accumulation and, thereby, shifts Ca(2+) oscillations toward sustained responses or dramatically prolonged spikes. PKC down-regulation attenuates phenylephrine-induced Ca(2+) wave velocity, whereas responses to IP3 uncaging are enhanced. The ability to assess Ca(2+) responses in the absence of PLC activity indicates that IP3 receptor modulation by PKC regulates Ca(2+) release and wave velocity.},

@article{wang2016,
	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3 Rs) are a family of ubiquitously expressed intracellular Ca(2+) release channels. Regulation of channel activity by Ca(2+) , nucleotides, phosphorylation, protein binding partners and other cellular factors is thought to play a major role in defining the specific spatiotemporal characteristics of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. These properties are, in turn, believed pivotal for the selective and specific physiological activation of Ca(2+) -dependent effectors. IP3 Rs are also substrates for the intracellular cysteine proteases, calpain and caspase. Cleavage of the IP3 R has been proposed to play a role in apoptotic cell death by uncoupling regions important for IP3 binding from the channel domain, leaving an unregulated leaky Ca(2+) pore. Contrary to this hypothesis, we demonstrate following proteolysis that N- and C-termini of IP3 R1 remain associated, presumably through non-covalent interactions. Further, we show that complementary fragments of IP3 R1 assemble into tetrameric structures and retain their ability to be regulated robustly by IP3 . While peptide continuity is clearly not necessary for IP3 -gating of the channel, we propose that cleavage of the IP3 R peptide chain may alter other important regulatory events to modulate channel activity. In this scenario, stimulation of the cleaved IP3 R may support distinct spatiotemporal Ca(2+) signals and activation of specific effectors. Notably, in many adaptive physiological events, the non-apoptotic activities of caspase and calpain are demonstrated to be important, but the substrates of the proteases are poorly defined. We speculate that proteolytic fragmentation may represent a novel form of IP3 R regulation, which plays a role in varied adaptive physiological processes.},

@article{chandrasekhar2016,
	Abstract = {The ability of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) to precisely initiate and generate a diverse variety of intracellular Ca(2+) signals is in part mediated by the differential regulation of the three subtypes (R1, R2, and R3) by key functional modulators (IP3, Ca(2+), and ATP). However, the contribution of IP3R heterotetramerization to Ca(2+) signal diversity has largely been unexplored. In this report, we provide the first definitive biochemical evidence of endogenous heterotetramer formation. Additionally, we examine the contribution of individual subtypes within defined concatenated heterotetramers to the shaping of Ca(2+) signals. Under conditions where key regulators of IP3R function are optimal for Ca(2+) release, we demonstrate that individual monomers within heteromeric IP3Rs contributed equally toward generating a distinct 'blended' sensitivity to IP3 that is likely dictated by the unique IP3 binding affinity of the heteromers. However, under suboptimal conditions where [ATP] were varied, we found that one subtype dictated the ATP regulatory properties of heteromers. We show that R2 monomers within a heterotetramer were both necessary and sufficient to dictate the ATP regulatory properties. Finally, the ATP-binding site B in R2 critical for ATP regulation was mutated and rendered non-functional to address questions relating to the stoichiometry of IP3R regulation. Two intact R2 monomers were sufficient to maintain ATP regulation in R2 homotetramers. In summary, we demonstrate that heterotetrameric IP3R do not necessarily behave as the sum of the constituent subunits, and these properties likely extend the versatility of IP3-induced Ca(2+) signaling in cells expressing multiple IP3R isoforms.},

	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) is an intracellular messenger that elicits a wide range of spatial and temporal Ca(2+) signals, and this signaling versatility is exploited to regulate diverse cellular responses. In this study, we have developed a series of IP(3) biosensors that exhibit strong pH stability and varying affinities for IP(3), as well as a method for the quantitative measurement of cytosolic concentrations of IP(3) ([IP(3)](i)) in single living cells. We applied this method to elucidate IP(3) dynamics during agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations, and we demonstrated cell type-dependent differences in IP(3) dynamics, a nonfluctuating rise in [IP(3)](i) and repetitive IP(3) spikes during Ca(2+) oscillations in COS-7 cells and HSY-EA1 cells, respectively. The size of the IP(3) spikes in HSY-EA1 cells varied from 10 to 100 nm, and the [IP(3)](i) spike peak was preceded by a Ca(2+) spike peak. These results suggest that repetitive IP(3) spikes in HSY-EA1 cells are passive reflections of Ca(2+) oscillations, and are unlikely to be essential for driving Ca(2+) oscillations. In addition, the interspike periods of Ca(2+) oscillations that occurred during the slow rise in [IP(3)](i) were not shortened by the rise in [IP(3)](i), indicating that IP(3)-dependent and -independent mechanisms may regulate the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations. The novel method described herein as well as the quantitative information obtained by using this method should provide a valuable and sound basis for future studies on the spatial and temporal regulations of IP(3) and Ca(2+).},

	Abstract = {We review a multiscale model of saliva secretion, describing in brief how the model is constructed and what we have so far learned from it. The model begins at the level of inositol trisphosphate receptors (IPR), and proceeds through the cellular level (with a model of acinar cell calcium dynamics) to the multicellular level (with a model of the acinus), finally to a model of a saliva production unit that includes an acinus and associated duct. The model at the level of the entire salivary gland is not yet completed. Particular results from the model so far include (i) the importance of modal behaviour of IPR, (ii) the relative unimportance of Ca(2+) oscillation frequency as a controller of saliva secretion, (iii) the need for the periodic Ca(2+) waves to be as fast as possible in order to maximise water transport, (iv) the presence of functional K(+) channels in the apical membrane increases saliva secretion, (v) the relative unimportance of acinar spatial structure for isotonic water transport, (vi) the prediction that duct cells are highly depolarised, (vii) the prediction that the secondary saliva takes at least 1mm (from the acinus) to reach ionic equilibrium. We end with a brief discussion of future directions for the model, both in construction and in the study of scientific questions.},

@article{becker1987,
	Abstract = {This study was performed to determine the effect of photobleaching on the spectral properties of the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2. Fura-2, whether in cells or in calibrating solutions, was found to be bleached when exposed to excitation light. In contrast to the widely held belief, photobleaching altered the spectral properties of the dye. Decomposition of the excitation spectra of partially bleached fura-2 solutions revealed an intermediate that is still fluorescent and is not sensitive to calcium over the same range as fura-2, but which can bind calcium in the millimolar range. The presence of this intermediate violates one of the assumptions on which the ratio method of calibration is based; that is, that the only fluorescent species present are the calcium-bound and the free anion forms of fura-2. Thus, if photobleaching occurs, the ratio method will not give accurate calcium concentration values. We calculate that as little as an 8% loss of total fluorescence intensity is sufficient to produce a large error. Photobleaching of fura-2-loaded cells and fura-2 containing calibrating solutions can be minimized by reducing the oxygen concentration and by reducing the excitation light intensity. Strategies are presented to help maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio in fura-2 fluorescence detection systems, despite a lower excitation intensity so that photobleaching, and the resulting inaccuracies in calculated [Ca2+], can be largely avoided.},

Recent efforts in structural analysis, engineering and screening have broken important performance thresholds in the latest generation for both classes. While these improvements have made GECIs a powerful means to perform physiology in living animals, a number of other aspects of sensor function deserve attention. These aspects include indicator linearity, toxicity and slow response kinetics. Furthermore creating high performance sensors with optically more favorable emission in red or infrared wavelengths as well as new stably or conditionally GECI-expressing animal lines are on the wish list. When the remaining issues are solved, imaging of GECIs will finally have crossed the last milestone, evolving from an initial promise into a fully matured technology.},

	Abstract = {Localized subcellular changes in Ca(2+) serve as important cellular signaling elements, regulating processes as diverse as neuronal excitability and gene expression. Studies of cellular Ca(2+) signaling have been greatly facilitated by the availability of fluorescent Ca(2+) indicators. The respective merits of different indicators to monitor bulk changes in cellular Ca(2+) levels have been widely evaluated, but a comprehensive comparison for their use in detecting and analyzing local, subcellular Ca(2+) signals is lacking. Here, we evaluated several fluorescent Ca(2+) indicators in the context of local Ca(2+) signals (puffs) evoked by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, using high-speed video-microscopy. Altogether, nine synthetic Ca(2+) dyes (Fluo-4, Fluo-8, Fluo-8 high affinity, Fluo-8 low affinity, Oregon Green BAPTA-1, Cal-520, Rhod-4, Asante Calcium Red, and X-Rhod-1) and three genetically-encoded Ca(2+)-indicators (GCaMP6-slow, -medium and -fast variants) were tested; criteria include the magnitude, kinetics, signal-to-noise ratio and detection efficiency of local Ca(2+) puffs. Among these, we conclude that Cal-520 is the optimal indicator for detecting and faithfully tracking local events; that Rhod-4 is the red-emitting indicator of choice; and that none of the GCaMP6 variants are well suited for imaging subcellular Ca(2+) signals.},

High-resolution crystal structures of GFP offer unprecedented opportunities to understand and manipulate the relation between protein structure and spectroscopic function. GFP has become well established as a marker of gene expression and protein targeting in intact cells and organisms. Mutagenesis and engineering of GFP into chimeric proteins are opening new vistas in physiological indicators, biosensors, and photochemical memories.},

	Abstract = {Calcium-signaling in cells requires a fine-tuned system of calcium-transport proteins involving ion channels, exchangers, and ion-pumps but also calcium-sensor proteins and their targets. Thus, control of physiological responses very often depends on incremental changes of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration, which are sensed by calcium-binding proteins and are further transmitted to specific target proteins. This Review will focus on calcium-signaling in vertebrate photoreceptor cells, where recent physiological and biochemical data indicate that a subset of neuronal calcium sensor proteins named guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) operate in a calcium-relay system, namely, to make gradual responses to small changes in calcium. We will further integrate this mechanism in an existing computational model of phototransduction showing that it is consistent and compatible with the dynamics that are characteristic for the precise operation of the phototransduction pathways.},

	Abstract = {The light responses of rod and cone photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina are quantitatively different, yet extremely stable and reproducible because of the extraordinary regulation of the cascade of enzymatic reactions that link photon absorption and visual pigment excitation to the gating of cGMP-gated ion channels in the outer segment plasma membrane. While the molecular scheme of the phototransduction pathway is essentially the same in rods and cones, the enzymes and protein regulators that constitute the pathway are distinct. These enzymes and regulators can differ in the quantitative features of their functions or in concentration if their functions are similar or both can be true. The molecular identity and distinct function of the molecules of the transduction cascade in rods and cones are summarized. The functional significance of these molecular differences is examined with a mathematical model of the signal-transducing enzymatic cascade. Constrained by available electrophysiological, biochemical and biophysical data, the model simulates photocurrents that match well the electrical photoresponses measured in both rods and cones. Using simulation computed with the mathematical model, the time course of light-dependent changes in enzymatic activities and second messenger concentrations in non-mammalian rods and cones are compared side by side.},

@article{hamer2000,
	Abstract = {We evaluated the generality of two models of vertebrate phototransduction. The approach was to quantitatively optimize each model to the full waveform of high-quality, dark-adapted (DA), salamander rod flash responses. With the optimal parameters, each model was then used to account for signature, qualitative features of rod responses from three experimental paradigms (stimulus/response, "S/R suite"): (1) step responses; (2) the intensity dependence of the period of photocurrent saturation (Tsat vs. ln(I)); and (3) light-adapted (LA) incremental flash sensitivity as a function of background intensity. The first model was the recent successful model of Nikonov et al. (1998). The second model replaced the instantaneous Ca2+ buffering used in the Nikonov et al. model with a dynamic buffer. The results showed that, in the absence of the dynamic Ca2+ buffer, the Nikonov et al. model does not have sufficient flexibility to provide a good fit to the flash responses, and, using the same parameters, reproduce the salient features of the S/R suite--critical features at step onset and offset are absent; the Tsat function has too shallow a slope; and the model cannot generate the empirically observed I-range of Weber-Fechner LA behavior. Some features could be recovered by changing parameters, but only at the expense of the fit to the reference (Ref) data. When the dynamic buffer is added, the model is able to achieve an acceptable fit to the Ref data while reproducing several features of the S/R suite, including an empirically observed Tsat function, and an extended range of LA flash sensitivity adhering to Weber's law. The overall improved behavior of the model with a dynamic Ca2+ buffer indicates that it is an important mechanism to include in a working model of phototransduction, and that, despite the slow kinetics of amphibian rods, Ca2+ buffering should not be simulated as an instantaneous process. However, neither model was able to capture all the features with the same parameters yielding the optimal fit to the Ref data. In addition, neither model could maintain a good fit to the Ref data when five key biochemical parameters were held at their current known values. Moreover, even after optimization, a number of important parameters remained outside their empirical estimates. We conclude that other mechanisms will need to be added, including additional Ca2+-feedback mechanisms. The present research illustrates the importance of a hybrid qualitative/quantitative approach to model development, and the limitations of modeling restricted sets of data.},

Since Ca(2+) regulates so many fundamental processes, it could be anticipated that numerous Ca(2+) channels and transporters will assist in regulating Ca(2+) entry across the plasma membrane. Towards this several Ca(2+) channels such as voltage-gated channels, store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) channels, NMDA, AMPA and other ligand gated channels have been identified. In recent years research focus has been targeted towards identification of the precise function of these essential channels. Furthermore, characterization of these individual Ca(2+) channels has also gained much attention, since specific Ca(2+) channels have been shown to influence a particular cellular response. Moreover, perturbations in these Ca(2+) channels have also been implicated in a spectrum of pathological conditions. Hence, understanding the precise involvement of these Ca(2+) channels in disease conditions would presumably unveil avenues for plausible therapeutic interventions. We thus review the role of Ca(2+) signaling in select -disease conditions and also provide experimental evidence as how they can be characterized in a given cell.},

	Abstract = {Endocrine pituitary cells express numerous voltage-gated Na(+), Ca(2+), K(+), and Cl(-) channels and several ligand-gated channels, and they fire action potentials spontaneously. Depending on the cell type, this electrical activity can generate localized or global Ca(2+) signals, the latter reaching the threshold for stimulus-secretion coupling. These cells also express numerous G-protein-coupled receptors, which can stimulate or silence electrical activity and Ca(2+) influx through voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels and hormone release. Receptors positively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway stimulate electrical activity with cAMP, which activates hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels directly, or by cAMP-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation of K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), and/or non-selective cation-conducting channels. Receptors that are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase signaling pathways inhibit spontaneous electrical activity and accompanied Ca(2+) transients predominantly through the activation of inwardly rectifying K(+) channels and the inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. The Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptors activate inositol trisphosphate-gated Ca(2+) channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to Ca(2+) release in an oscillatory or non-oscillatory manner, depending on the cell type. This Ca(2+) release causes a cell type-specific modulation of electrical activity and intracellular Ca(2+) handling.},

	Abstract = {A 3D model was developed and used to explore dynamics of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) signaling in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Long-term depression in Purkinje neurons depends on coincidence detection of climbing fiber stimulus evoking extracellular calcium flux into the cell and parallel fiber stimulus evoking inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-meditated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Experimental evidence shows that large concentrations of IP3 are required for calcium release. This study uses computational analysis to explore how the Purkinje cell provides sufficient PIP2 to produce large amounts of IP3. Results indicate that baseline PIP2 concentration levels in the plasma membrane are inadequate, even if the model allows for PIP2 replenishment by lateral diffusion from neighboring dendrite membrane. Lateral diffusion analysis indicates apparent anomalous diffusion of PIP2 in the spiny dendrite membrane, due to restricted diffusion through spine necks. Stimulated PIP2 synthesis and elevated spine PIP2 mediated by a local sequestering protein were explored as candidate mechanisms to supply sufficient PIP2. Stimulated synthesis can indeed lead to high IP3 amplitude of long duration; local sequestration produces high IP3 amplitude, but of short duration. Simulation results indicate that local sequestration could explain the experimentally observed finely tuned timing between parallel fiber and climbing fiber activation.},

	Abstract = {Local elevations in intracellular calcium ("Ca2+ sparks") in heart muscle are elementary sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-release events. Ca2+ sparks occur at a low rate in quiescent cells but can also be evoked by electrical stimulation of the cell to produce the cell-wide Ca2+ transient. In this study we investigate how Ca2+ sparks are related to propagating waves of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ induced by "Ca2+ overload." Single ventricular myocytes from rat were loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive indicator fluo 3 and imaged with a confocal microscope. After extracellular Ca2+ concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mM to produce Ca2+ overload, the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks, which occur at the t tubule/SR junction, increased approximately 4-fold, whereas the spark amplitude and spatial size increased 4.1-and 1.7-fold, respectively. In addition, a spectrum of larger subcellular events, including propagating Ca2+ waves, was observed. Ca2+ sparks were seen to occur at the majority (65%) of the sites of wave initiation. For slowly propagating Ca2+ waves, discrete Ca(2+)-release events, similar to Ca2+ sparks, were detected in the wave front. These Ca2+ sparks appeared to recruit other sparks along the wave front so that the wave progressed in a saltatory manner. We conclude that Ca2+ sparks are elementary events that can explain both the initiation and propagation of Ca2+ waves. In addition, we show that Ca2+ waves and electrically evoked Ca2+ transients have the same time course and interact with each other in a manner that is consistent with both phenomena having the same underlying mechanism(s). These results suggest that SR Ca2+ release during Ca2+ waves, like that during normal excitation-contraction coupling, results from the spatial and temporal summation of Ca2+ sparks.},

	Abstract = {1. Subcellularly localized Ca2+ signals have been proposed to represent elementary events of cardiac Ca2+ signalling (Ca2+ sparks), whereby an individual sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channel locally controls opening of a single (or a few) Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). 2. To investigate directly the elementary nature of this Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release mechanism we used flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ while simultaneously measuring the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with a laser-scanning confocal microscope. 3. Power spectral analysis of the confocal images performed in the spatial domain revealed that only Ca2+ signalling events involving the L-type Ca2+ channel pathway gave rise to Ca2+ sparks. In contrast, SR Ca2+ release triggered by photolytic [Ca2+]i jumps resulted in Ca2+ transients that were always spatially homogeneous. 4. From these findings we conclude that the fundamental event of Ca2+ signalling in cardiac muscle may be smaller in size or amplitude than a Ca2+ spark. 5. We term this event a 'Ca2+ quark' possibly resulting from gating of a single SR Ca2+ release channel. It is proposed that concerted activation of several 'Ca2+ quarks' may be required for a Ca2+ spark. The 'Ca2+ quark' could also be the fundamental event in other cell types implementing a hierarchical Ca2+ signalling concept.},

	Abstract = {1. Vasomotion is the oscillation of vascular tone with frequencies in the range from 1 to 20 min(-1) seen in most vascular beds. The oscillation originates in the vessel wall and is seen both in vivo and in vitro. 2. Recently, our ideas on the cellular mechanisms responsible for vasomotion have improved. Three different types of cellular oscillations have been suggested. One model has suggested that oscillatory release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is important (the oscillation is based on a cytosolic oscillator). A second proposed mechanism is an oscillation originating in the sarcolemma (a membrane oscillator). A third mechanism is based on an oscillation of glycolysis (metabolic oscillator). For the two latter mechanisms, only limited experimental evidence is available. 3. To understand vasomotion, it is important to understand how the cells synchronize. For the cytosolic oscillators synchronization may occur via activation of Ca2+-sensitive ion channels by oscillatory Ca2+ release. The ensuing membrane potential oscillation feeds back on the intracellular Ca2+ stores and causes synchronization of the Ca2+ release. While membrane oscillators in adjacent smooth muscle cells could be synchronized through the same mechanism that sets up the oscillation in the individual cells, a mechanism to synchronize the metabolic-based oscillators has not been suggested. 4. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by theoretical modelling of smooth muscle cells behaviour, and the new insight into the mechanisms of vasomotion has the potential to provide tools to investigate the physiological role of vasomotion.},

To generate realistic results, synapse-specific Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and depression, must be augmented by global processes that regulate overall levels of neuronal and network activity. Regulatory processes are often as important as the more intensively studied Hebbian processes in determining the consequences of synaptic plasticity for network function. Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. We review three of them-synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic redistribution-and discuss their functional implications.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) activation of Cl and K channels is a key event underlying stimulated fluid secretion from parotid salivary glands. Cl channels are exclusively present on the apical plasma membrane (PM), whereas the localization of K channels has not been established. Mathematical models have suggested that localization of some K channels to the apical PM is optimum for fluid secretion. A combination of whole cell electrophysiology and temporally resolved digital imaging with local manipulation of intracellular [Ca(2+)] was used to investigate if Ca(2+)-activated K channels are present in the apical PM of parotid acinar cells. Initial experiments established Ca(2+)-buffering conditions that produced brief, localized increases in [Ca(2+)] after focal laser photolysis of caged Ca(2+). Conditions were used to isolate K(+) and Cl(-) conductances. Photolysis at the apical PM resulted in a robust increase in K(+) and Cl(-) currents. A localized reduction in [Ca(2+)] at the apical PM after photolysis of Diazo-2, a caged Ca(2+) chelator, resulted in a decrease in both K(+) and Cl(-) currents. The K(+) currents evoked by apical photolysis were partially blocked by both paxilline and TRAM-34, specific blockers of large-conductance &quot;maxi-K&quot; (BK) and intermediate K (IK), respectively, and almost abolished by incubation with both antagonists. Apical TRAM-34-sensitive K(+) currents were also observed in BK-null parotid acini. In contrast, when the [Ca(2+)] was increased at the basal or lateral PM, no increase in either K(+) or Cl(-) currents was evoked. These data provide strong evidence that K and Cl channels are similarly distributed in the apical PM. Furthermore, both IK and BK channels are present in this domain, and the density of these channels appears higher in the apical versus basolateral PM. Collectively, this study provides support for a model in which fluid secretion is optimized after expression of K channels specifically in the apical PM.},

	Abstract = {Vertebrate genomes code for three subtypes of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3R1, -2, and -3). Individual IP3R monomers are assembled to form homo- and heterotetrameric channels that mediate Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. IP3R subtypes are regulated differentially by IP3, Ca(2+), ATP, and various other cellular factors and events. IP3R subtypes are seldom expressed in isolation in individual cell types, and cells often express different complements of IP3R subtypes. When multiple subtypes of IP3R are co-expressed, the subunit composition of channels cannot be specifically defined. Thus, how the subunit composition of heterotetrameric IP3R channels contributes to shaping the spatio-temporal properties of IP3-mediated Ca(2+) signals has been difficult to evaluate. To address this question, we created concatenated IP3R linked by short flexible linkers. Dimeric constructs were expressed in DT40-3KO cells, an IP3R null cell line. The dimeric proteins were localized to membranes, ran as intact dimeric proteins on SDS-PAGE, and migrated as an ∼1100-kDa band on blue native gels exactly as wild type IP3R. Importantly, IP3R channels formed from concatenated dimers were fully functional as indicated by agonist-induced Ca(2+) release. Using single channel "on-nucleus" patch clamp, the channels assembled from homodimers were essentially indistinguishable from those formed by the wild type receptor. However, the activity of channels formed from concatenated IP3R1 and IP3R2 heterodimers was dominated by IP3R2 in terms of the characteristics of regulation by ATP. These studies provide the first insight into the regulation of heterotetrameric IP3R of defined composition. Importantly, the results indicate that the properties of these channels are not simply a blend of those of the constituent IP3R monomers.},

	Abstract = {Neurotransmitter stimulation of plasma membrane receptors stimulates salivary gland fluid secretion via a complex process that is determined by coordinated temporal and spatial regulation of several Ca(2+) signaling processes as well as ion flux systems. Studies over the past four decades have demonstrated that Ca(2+) is a critical factor in the control of salivary gland function. Importantly, critical components of this process have now been identified, including plasma membrane receptors, calcium channels, and regulatory proteins. The key event in activation of fluid secretion is an increase in intracellular [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)]i) triggered by IP3-induced release of Ca(2+) from ER via the IP3R. This increase regulates the ion fluxes required to drive vectorial fluid secretion. IP3Rs determine the site of initiation and the pattern of [Ca(2+)]i signal in the cell. However, Ca(2+) entry into the cell is required to sustain the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i and fluid secretion. This Ca(2+) influx pathway, store-operated calcium influx pathway (SOCE), has been studied in great detail and the regulatory mechanisms as well as key molecular components have now been identified. Orai1, TRPC1, and STIM1 are critical components of SOCE and among these, Ca(2+) entry via TRPC1 is a major determinant of fluid secretion. The receptor-evoked Ca(2+) signal in salivary gland acinar cells is unique in that it starts at the apical pole and then rapidly increases across the cell. The basis for the polarized Ca(2+) signal can be ascribed to the polarized arrangement of the Ca(2+) channels, transporters, and signaling proteins. Distinct localization of these proteins in the cell suggests compartmentalization of Ca(2+) signals during regulation of fluid secretion. This chapter will discuss new concepts and findings regarding the polarization and control of Ca(2+) signals in the regulation of fluid secretion.},

	Abstract = {Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent calcium ion (Ca²+) signaling in astrocytic processes regulates synaptic transmission and local blood flow essential for brain function. However, because of difficulties in imaging astrocytic processes, the subcellular spatial organization of mGluR-dependent Ca²+ signaling is not well characterized and its regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Using genetically encoded Ca²+ indicators, we showed that despite global stimulation by an mGluR agonist, astrocyte processes intrinsically exhibited a marked enrichment of Ca²+ responses. Immunocytochemistry indicated that these polarized Ca²+ responses could be attributed to increased density of surface mGluR5 on processes relative to the soma. Single-particle tracking of surface mGluR5 dynamics revealed a membrane barrier that blocked the movement of mGluR5 between the processes and the soma. Overexpression of mGluR or expression of its carboxyl terminus enabled diffusion of mGluR5 between the soma and the processes, disrupting the polarization of mGluR5 and of mGluR-dependent Ca²+ signaling. Together, our results demonstrate an mGluR5-selective diffusion barrier between processes and soma that compartmentalized mGluR Ca²+ signaling in astrocytes and may allow control of synaptic and vascular activity in specific subcellular domains.},

@article{ashby2002,
	Abstract = {This review examines polarized calcium and calmodulin signaling in exocrine epithelial cells. The calcium ion is a simple, evolutionarily ancient, and universal second messenger. In exocrine epithelial cells, it regulates essential functions such as exocytosis, fluid secretion, and gene expression. Exocrine cells are structurally polarized, with the apical region usually dedicated to secretion. Recent advances in technology, in particular the development of videoimaging and confocal microscopy, have led to the discovery of polarized, subcellular calcium signals in these cell types. The properties of a rich variety of local and global calcium signals have now been described in secretory epithelial cells. Secretagogues stimulate apical-to-basal waves of calcium in many exocrine cell types, but there are some interesting exceptions to this rule. The shapes of intracellular calcium signals are determined by the distribution of calcium-releasing channels and mechanisms that limit calcium elevation. Polarized distribution of calcium-handling mechanisms also leads to transcellular calcium transport in exocrine epithelial cells. This transport can deliver considerable amounts of calcium into secreted fluids. Multicellular polarized calcium signals can coordinate the activity of many individual cells in epithelial secretory tissue. Certain particularly sensitive cells serve as pacemakers for initiation of intercellular calcium waves. Many calcium signaling pathways involve activation of calmodulin. This ubiquitous protein regulates secretion in exocrine cells and also activates interesting feedback interactions with calcium channels and transporters. Very recently it became possible to directly study polarized calcium-calmodulin reactions and to visualize the process of hormone-induced redistribution of calmodulin in live cells. The structural and functional polarity of secretory epithelia alongside the polarity of its calcium and calmodulin signaling present an interesting lesson in tissue organization.},

	Abstract = {The metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors mGlu1 and mGlu5 mediate distinct inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and Ca(2+) signaling patterns, governed in part by differential mechanisms of feedback regulation after activation. Single cell imaging has shown that mGlu1 receptors initiate sustained elevations in IP(3) and Ca(2+), which are sensitive to agonist concentration. In contrast, mGlu5 receptors are subject to cyclical PKC-dependent uncoupling and consequently mediate coincident IP(3) and Ca(2+) oscillations that are largely independent of agonist concentration. In this study, we investigated the contribution of G(q/11)alpha protein expression levels in shaping mGlu1/5 receptor-mediated IP(3) and Ca(2+) signals, using RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi-mediated knockdown of G(q/11)alpha almost abolished the single-cell increase in IP(3) caused by mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptor activation. For the mGlu1 receptor, this unmasked baseline Ca(2+) oscillations that persisted even at maximal agonist concentrations. mGlu5 receptor-activated Ca(2+) oscillations were still observed but were only initiated at high agonist concentrations. Recombinant overexpression of G(q)alpha enhanced IP(3) signals after mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptor activation. It is noteworthy that although mGlu5 receptor-mediated IP(3) and Ca(2+) oscillations in control cells were largely insensitive to agonist concentration, increasing G(q)alpha expression converted these oscillatory signatures to sustained plateau responses in a high proportion of cells. In addition to modulating temporal Ca(2+) signals, up- or down-regulation of G(q/11)alpha expression alters the threshold for the concentration of glutamate at which a measurable Ca(2+) signal could be detected. These experiments indicate that altering G(q/11)alpha expression levels differentially affects spatiotemporal aspects of IP(3) and Ca(2+) signaling mediated by the mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors.},

	Abstract = {We construct a minimal model of cytosolic free Ca2+ oscillations based on Ca2+ release via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor/Ca2+ channel (IP3R) of a single intracellular Ca2+ pool. The model relies on experimental evidence that the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c) modulates the IP3R in a biphasic manner, with Ca2+ release inhibited by low and high [Ca2+]c and facilitated by intermediate [Ca2+]c, and that channel inactivation occurs on a slower time scale than activation. The model produces [Ca2+]c oscillations at constant [IP3] and reproduces a number of crucial experiments. The two-dimensional spatial model with IP3 dynamics, cytosolic diffusion of IP3 (Dp = 300 microns 2 s-1), and cytosolic diffusion of Ca2+ (Dc = 20 microns 2 s-1) produces circular, planar, and spiral waves of Ca2+ with speeds of 7-15 microns.s-1, which annihilate upon collision. Increasing extracellular [Ca2+] influx increases wave speed and baseline [Ca2+]c. A [Ca2+]c-dependent Ca2+ diffusion coefficient does not alter the qualitative behavior of the model. An important model prediction is that channel inactivation must occur on a slower time scale than activation in order for waves to propagate. The model serves to capture the essential macroscopic mechanisms that are involved in the production of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and traveling waves in the Xenopus laevis oocyte.},

	Abstract = {The relative contribution of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors (IP(3)Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to agonist-induced Ca(2+) signaling in mouse airway smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was investigated in lung slices with phase-contrast or laser scanning microscopy. At room temperature (RT), methacholine (MCh) or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induced Ca(2+) oscillations and an associated contraction in small airway SMCs. The subsequent exposure to an IP(3)R antagonist, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), inhibited the Ca(2+) oscillations and induced airway relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. 2-APB also inhibited Ca(2+) waves generated by the photolytic release of IP(3). However, the RyR antagonist ryanodine had no significant effect, at any concentration, on airway contraction or agonist- or IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) oscillations or Ca(2+) wave propagation. By contrast, a second RyR antagonist, tetracaine, relaxed agonist-contracted airways and inhibited agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in a concentration-dependent manner. However, tetracaine did not affect IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release or wave propagation nor the Ca(2+) content of SMC Ca(2+) stores as evaluated by Ca(2+)-release induced by caffeine. Conversely, both ryanodine and tetracaine completely blocked agonist-independent slow Ca(2+) oscillations induced by KCl. The inhibitory effects of 2-APB and absence of an effect of ryanodine on MCh-induced airway contraction or Ca(2+) oscillations of SMCs were also observed at 37 degrees C. In Ca(2+)-permeable SMCs, tetracaine inhibited agonist-induced contraction without affecting intracellular Ca(2+) levels indicating that relaxation also resulted from a reduction in Ca(2+) sensitivity. These results indicate that agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in mouse small airway SMCs are primary mediated via IP(3)Rs and that tetracaine induces relaxation by both decreasing Ca(2+) sensitivity and inhibiting agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations via an IP(3)-dependent mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) sparks are highly localized, transient releases of Ca(2+) from sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors (RyRs). In smooth muscle, Ca(2+) sparks trigger spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) by opening nearby clusters of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels, and also gate Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) (Cl((Ca))) channels to induce spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs). While the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of STOCs by Ca(2+) sparks is well understood, little information is available on how Ca(2+) sparks activate STICs. In the present study, we investigated the spatial organization of RyRs and Cl((Ca)) channels in spark sites in airway myocytes from mouse. Ca(2+) sparks and STICs were simultaneously recorded, respectively, with high-speed, widefield digital microscopy and whole-cell patch-clamp. An image-based approach was applied to measure the Ca(2+) current underlying a Ca(2+) spark (I(Ca(spark))), with an appropriate correction for endogenous fixed Ca(2+) buffer, which was characterized by flash photolysis of NPEGTA. We found that I(Ca(spark)) rises to a peak in 9 ms and decays with a single exponential with a time constant of 12 ms, suggesting that Ca(2+) sparks result from the nonsimultaneous opening and closure of multiple RyRs. The onset of the STIC lags the onset of the I(Ca(spark)) by less than 3 ms, and its rising phase matches the duration of the I(Ca(spark)). We further determined that Cl((Ca)) channels on average are exposed to a [Ca(2+)] of 2.4 microM or greater during Ca(2+) sparks. The area of the plasma membrane reaching this level is <600 nm in radius, as revealed by the spatiotemporal profile of [Ca(2+)] produced by a reaction-diffusion simulation with measured I(Ca(spark)). Finally we estimated that the number of Cl((Ca)) channels localized in Ca(2+) spark sites could account for all the Cl((Ca)) channels in the entire cell. Taken together these results lead us to propose a model in which RyRs and Cl((Ca)) channels in Ca(2+) spark sites localize near to each other, and, moreover, Cl((Ca)) channels concentrate in an area with a radius of approximately 600 nm, where their density reaches as high as 300 channels/microm(2). This model reveals that Cl((Ca)) channels are tightly controlled by Ca(2+) sparks via local Ca(2+) signaling.},

	Abstract = {In pancreatic B- and A-cells, metabolic stimuli regulate biochemical and electrical processes that culminate in Ca2+-influx and release of insulin or glucagon, respectively. Like in other (neuro)endocrine cells, Ca2+-influx triggers the rapid exocytosis of hormone-containing secretory granules. Only a small fraction of granules (<1% in insulin-secreting B-cells) can be released immediately, while the remainder requires translocation to the plasma membrane and further "priming" for release by several ATP- and Ca2+-dependent reactions. Such functional organization may account for systemic features such as the biphasic time course of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Since this release pattern is altered in type-2 diabetes mellitus, it is conceivable that disturbances in the exocytotic machinery underlie the disease. Here I will review recent data from our laboratory relevant for the understanding of these processes in insulin-secreting B-cells and glucagon-secreting A-cells and for the identification of novel targets for antidiabetic drug action. Two aspects are discussed in detail: 1) The importance of a tight interaction between L-type Ca2+-channels and the exocytotic machinery for efficient secretion; and 2) the role of intragranular acidification for the priming of secretory granules and its regulation by a granular 65-kDa sulfonylurea-binding protein.},

	Abstract = {The release of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca in cardiac muscle during excitation-contraction coupling is known to be graded by the amount of activating Ca outside the SR (i.e., Ca-induced Ca release). However, little is known about how intra-SR Ca affects the release process. In this study we assessed how the fractional SR Ca release as described by Bassani et al. [Am. J. Physiol. 265 (Cell Physiol. 34): C533-C540, 1993] is affected by alteration of trigger Ca and of SR Ca content. Experiments were done with isolated ferret ventricular myocytes using indo 1 to measure Ca concentration, perforated patch to measure Ca current (ICa), caffeine application to release SR Ca, and thapsigargin to completely block SR Ca uptake. For what we consider a Normal SR Ca load and trigger Ca [action potential at 0.5 Hz with 2 mM extracellular Ca concentration ([Ca]o)], 35 +/- 3% of the SR Ca content was released at a twitch. Changing trigger Ca by altering [Ca]o (to 0.5 and 8 mM) at a test twitch changed this fractional SR Ca release to 10 +/- 2 and 59 +/- 6%, with the same SR Ca load (and peak ICa changed in a parallel manner in separate voltage-clamp experiments). Three different levels of SR Ca load were studied (Low, Normal, and High; by action potential stimulation at different frequencies from 0.05 to 0.8 Hz) using the same standard test trigger Ca (2 mM). Surprisingly, the High-load condition only increased SR Ca content by approximately 4% but appeared to be very close to the limiting SR Ca capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Intracellular Ca signaling is governed by diffusion and buffering of Ca ions. Mobile endogenous buffers increase the redistribution of Ca ions and tend to restrict the regions of elevated Ca concentrations to the close vicinity of the channel. These Ca microdomains dominate fast Ca signaling, as observed, e.g., in synaptic transmission. The steady-state solution of the linearized differential equations of buffered Ca diffusion, as developed by Neher and Naraghi and Neher, will be reviewed and generalized to the case of more than two buffers. Immobile buffers do not enter the steady-state equations, but instead slow down Ca diffusion and prolong the time to reach the steady state. Based on this phenomenon, a quite different putative mechanism to localize Ca will be suggested that is likely to be realized in photoreceptors where Ca source, Ca sink, and Ca sensor form a complex, as was recently reported.},

@article{baughman2011,
	Abstract = {Mitochondria from diverse organisms are capable of transporting large amounts of Ca(2+) via a ruthenium-red-sensitive, membrane-potential-dependent mechanism called the uniporter. Although the uniporter's biophysical properties have been studied extensively, its molecular composition remains elusive. We recently used comparative proteomics to identify MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), an EF-hand-containing protein that serves as a putative regulator of the uniporter. Here, we use whole-genome phylogenetic profiling, genome-wide RNA co-expression analysis and organelle-wide protein coexpression analysis to predict proteins functionally related to MICU1. All three methods converge on a novel predicted transmembrane protein, CCDC109A, that we now call 'mitochondrial calcium uniporter' (MCU). MCU forms oligomers in the mitochondrial inner membrane, physically interacts with MICU1, and resides within a large molecular weight complex. Silencing MCU in cultured cells or in vivo in mouse liver severely abrogates mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, whereas mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential remain fully intact. MCU has two predicted transmembrane helices, which are separated by a highly conserved linker facing the intermembrane space. Acidic residues in this linker are required for its full activity. However, an S259A point mutation retains function but confers resistance to Ru360, the most potent inhibitor of the uniporter. Our genomic, physiological, biochemical and pharmacological data firmly establish MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter.},

	Abstract = {Cannell and Allen (1984. Biophys. J. 45:913-925) introduced the use of a multi-compartment model to estimate the time course of spread of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a half sarcomere of a frog skeletal muscle fiber activated by an action potential. Under the assumption that the sites of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release are located radially around each myofibril at the Z line, their model calculated the spread of released Ca2+ both along and into the half sarcomere. During diffusion, Ca2+ was assumed to react with metal-binding sites on parvalbumin (a diffusible Ca2+- and Mg2+-binding protein) as well as with fixed sites on troponin. We have developed a similar model, but with several modifications that reflect current knowledge of the myoplasmic environment and SR Ca2+ release. We use a myoplasmic diffusion constant for free Ca2+ that is twofold smaller and an SR Ca2+ release function in response to an action potential that is threefold briefer than used previously. Additionally, our model includes the effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding by adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and the diffusion of Ca2+-bound ATP (CaATP). Under the assumption that the total myoplasmic concentration of ATP is 8 mM and that the amplitude of SR Ca2+ release is sufficient to drive the peak change in free [Ca2+] (Delta[Ca2+]) to 18 microM (the approximate spatially averaged value that is observed experimentally), our model calculates that (a) the spatially averaged peak increase in [CaATP] is 64 microM; (b) the peak saturation of troponin with Ca2+ is high along the entire thin filament; and (c) the half-width of Delta[Ca2+] is consistent with that observed experimentally. Without ATP, the calculated half-width of spatially averaged Delta[Ca2+] is abnormally brief, and troponin saturation away from the release sites is markedly reduced. We conclude that Ca2+ binding by ATP and diffusion of CaATP make important contributions to the determination of the amplitude and the time course of Delta[Ca2+].},

	Abstract = {Calcium sparks in frog intact skeletal muscle fibers were modeled as stereotypical events that arise from a constant efflux of Ca(2+) from a point source for a fixed period of time (e.g., 2.5 pA of Ca(2+) current for 4.6 ms; 18 degrees C). The model calculates the local changes in the concentrations of free Ca(2+) and of Ca(2+) bound to the major intrinsic myoplasmic Ca(2+) buffers (troponin, ATP, parvalbumin, and the SR Ca(2+) pump) and to the Ca(2+) indicator (fluo-3). A distinctive feature of the model is the inclusion of a binding reaction between fluo-3 and myoplasmic proteins, a process that strongly affects fluo-3's Ca(2+)-reaction kinetics, its apparent diffusion constant, and hence the morphology of sparks. DeltaF/F (the change in fluo-3's fluorescence divided by its resting fluorescence) was estimated from the calculated changes in fluo-3 convolved with the microscope point-spread function. To facilitate comparisons with measured sparks, noise and other sources of variability were included in a random repetitive fashion to generate a large number of simulated sparks that could be analyzed in the same way as the measured sparks. In the initial simulations, the binding of Ca(2+) to the two regulatory sites on troponin was assumed to follow identical and independent binding reactions. These simulations failed to accurately predict the falling phase of the measured sparks. A second set of simulations, which incorporated the idea of positive cooperativity in the binding of Ca(2+) to troponin, produced reasonable agreement with the measurements. Under the assumption that the single channel Ca(2+) current of a ryanodine receptor (RYR) is 0.5-2 pA, the results suggest that 1-5 active RYRs generate an average Ca(2+) spark in a frog intact muscle fiber.},

	Abstract = {A Monte Carlo analysis has been made of the phenomenon of facilitation, whereby a conditioning impulse leaves nerve terminals in a state of heightened release of quanta by a subsequent test impulse, this state persisting for periods of hundreds of milliseconds. It is shown that a quantitative account of facilitation at the amphibian neuromuscular junction can be given if the exocytosis is triggered by the combined action of a low-affinity calcium-binding molecule at the site of exocytosis and a high-affinity calcium-binding molecule some distance away. The kinetic properties and spatial distribution of these molecules at the amphibian neuromuscular junction are arrived at by considering the appropriate values that the relevant parameters must take to successfully account for the experimentally observed amplitude and time course of decline of F1 and F2 facilitation after a conditioning impulse, as well as the growth of facilitation during short trains of impulses. This model of facilitation correctly predicts the effects on facilitation of exogenous buffers such as BAPTA during short trains of impulses. In addition, it accounts for the relative invariance of the kinetics of quantal release due to test-conditioning sequences of impulses as well as due to change in the extent of calcium influx during an impulse.},

	Abstract = {A principal means of transmitting intracellular calcium (Ca2+) waves at junctions between astrocytes involves the release of the chemical transmitter adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A model of this process is presented in which activation of purinergic P2Y receptors by ATP triggers the release of ATP, in an autocrine manner, as well as concomitantly increasing intracellular Ca2+. The dependence of the temporal characteristics of the Ca2+ wave are shown to critically depend on the dissociation constant (K(R)) for ATP binding to the P2Y receptor type. Incorporating this model astrocyte into networks of these cells successfully accounts for many of the properties of propagating Ca2+ waves, such as the dependence of velocity on the type of P2Y receptor and the time-lag of the Ca2+ wave behind the ATP wave. In addition, the conditions under which Ca2+ waves may jump from one set of astrocytes across an astrocyte-free lane to another set of astrocytes are quantitatively accounted for by the model. The properties of purinergic transmission at astrocyte junctions may determine many of the characteristics of Ca2+ propagation in networks of these cells.},

	Abstract = {The effects of the hormone 5-hydroxytryptamine, its analogues and
	its antagonists on the electrical activity and secretion rate of
	isolated salivary glands of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala
	were investigated. The secretion rate increases linearly with the
	logarithm of hormone concentration between 10−9 and 10−8M. At
	>10−8M the transepithelial potential depolarizes and rapidly attains
	a new stable value. However, at intermediate hormone concentrations,
	the potential does not maintain a stable intermediate value but displays
	sustained oscillations. These oscillations are not an artifact resulting
	from periodic variations in hormone concentration. The frequency
	of the oscillations increases with hormone concentration and with
	the concentration of external calcium and hormone analogues. The
	frequency decreases following the addition of lanthanum to the perfusion
	medium.The experimental results suggest that the potential oscillation
	may be driven by an oscillation in the intracellular concentrations
	of cyclic AMP and calcium. It is argued that oscillatory control
	provides a reliable, noise-resistant strategy for controlling secretion

This interest in cell signaling began with studies on the control of fluid secretion by an insect salivary gland, and the subsequent quest led to the discovery of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and its role in calcium signaling, which effectively divided my scientific career into two distinct parts. The first part was primarily experimental and culminated in the discovery of IP3, which set the agenda for the second half during which I have enjoyed exploring the many functions of this remarkably versatile signaling system. It has been particularly exciting to find out how this IP3/Ca2+ signaling pathway has been adapted to control processes as diverse as fertilization, proliferation, cell contraction, secretion, and information processing in neuronal cells.},

	Abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction is controlled by the Ca2+ and Rho kinase signalling pathways. While the SMC Rho kinase system seems to be reasonably constant, there is enormous variation with regard to the mechanisms responsible for generating Ca2+ signals. One way of dealing with this diversity is to consider how this system has been adapted to control different SMC functions. Phasic SMCs (vas deferens, uterus and bladder) rely on membrane depolarization to drive Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This depolarization can be induced by neurotransmitters or through the operation of a membrane oscillator. Many tonic SMCs (vascular, airway and corpus cavernosum) are driven by a cytosolic Ca2+ oscillator that generates periodic pulses of Ca2+. A similar oscillator is present in pacemaker cells such as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and atypical SMCs that control other tonic SMCs (gastrointestinal, urethra, ureter). The changes in membrane potential induced by these cytosolic oscillators does not drive contraction directly but it functions to couple together individual oscillators to provide the synchronization that is a characteristic feature of many tonic SMCs.},

Ongoing transcriptional processes maintain the integrity and stability of these cell-specific signalling systems.

	Abstract = {1. We describe a model of transmitter release that is based on the finding that release can be gated during the opening of individual Ca2+ channels, suggesting that the release site can be activated by the Ca2+ domain under a single channel. In this model each release site contains four independent Ca2+ binding sites or gates with unbinding kinetics graded from slow to fast and affinities ranging from high to low. All four gates must be bound for release to occur. Thus synaptic dynamics are governed by the kinetics of Ca2+ binding and unbinding from release sites, not Ca2+ diffusion. 2. Fast facilitation occurs when an action potential invades a terminal with one or more ions remaining bound to the release sites. Residual free Ca2+ is not necessary for facilitation with this mechanism, but if present it would enhance facilitation by binding to high-affinity gates between pulses. 3. This model can account for key features of release. These include fourth-power cooperativity with regard to external Ca2+; a release time course that is virtually independent of an increase in quantal content; an inverse relation between external Ca2+ and the degree of facilitation; and a steplike increase in facilitation with increasing stimulus frequency, with each step corresponding to a unitary decline in the Ca2+ cooperativity. 4. Facilitation of single-channel-based secretion is shown to be robust even if channel opening is stochastic. Spontaneous release of transmitter, assumed to be due in part to spontaneous Ca2+ channel openings, is shown to be elevated during and after a train of impulses. 5. An extension of the model to include multiple Ca2+ channels per release site demonstrates that one role of overlapping Ca2+ domains may be to accentuate depolarization-evoked release relative to spontaneous release.},

	Abstract = {Although single-channel Ca2+ microdomains are capable of gating neurotransmitter release in some instances, it is likely that in many cases the microdomains from several open channels overlap to activate vesicle fusion. We describe a mathematical model in which transmitter release is gated by single or overlapping Ca2+ microdomains produced by the opening of nearby Ca2+ channels. This model accounts for the presence of a mobile Ca2+ buffer, provided either that the buffer is unsaturable or that it is saturated near an open channel with Ca2+ binding kinetics that are rapid relative to Ca2+ diffusion. We show that the release time course is unaffected by the location of the channels (at least for distances up to 50 nm), but paired-pulse facilitation is greater when the channels are farther from the release sites. We then develop formulas relating the fractional release following selective or random channel blockage to the cooperative relationship between release and the presynaptic Ca2+ current. These formulas are used with the transmitter release model to study the dependence of this form of cooperativity, which we call Ca2+ current cooperativity, on mobile buffers and on the local geometry of Ca2+ channels. We find that Ca2+ current cooperativity increases with the number of channels per release site, but is considerably less than the number of channels, the theoretical upper bound. In the presence of a saturating mobile buffer the Ca2+ current cooperativity is greater, and it increases more rapidly with the number of channels. Finally, Ca2+ current cooperativity is an increasing function of channel distance, particularly in the presence of saturating mobile buffer.},

	Abstract = {Insulin-secreting beta-cells, located within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, are excitable cells that produce regular bursts of action potentials when stimulated by glucose. This system has been the focus of mathematical investigation for two decades, spawning an array of mathematical models. Recently, a new class of models has been introduced called 'phantom bursters' [Bertram et al. (2000) Biophys. J. 79, 2880-2892], which accounts for the wide range of burst frequencies exhibited by islets via the interaction of more than one slow process. Here, we describe one implementation of the phantom bursting mechanism in which intracellular Ca2+ controls the oscillations through both direct and indirect negative feedback pathways. We show how the model dynamics can be understood through an extension of the fast/slow analysis that is typically employed for bursting oscillations. From this perspective, the model makes use of multiple degrees of freedom to generate the full range of bursting oscillations exhibited by beta-cells. The model also accounts for a wide range of experimental phenomena, including the ubiquitous triphasic response to the step elevation of glucose and responses to perturbations of internal Ca2+ stores. Although it is not presently a complete model of all beta-cell properties, it demonstrates the design principles that we anticipate will underlie future progress in beta-cell modeling.},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic islets of Langerhans produce bursts of electrical activity when exposed to stimulatory glucose levels. These bursts often have a regular repeating pattern, with a period of 10-60 s. In some cases, however, the bursts are episodic, clustered into bursts of bursts, which we call compound bursting. Consistent with this are recordings of free Ca2+ concentration, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intraislet glucose levels that exhibit very slow oscillations, with faster oscillations superimposed. We describe a new mathematical model of the pancreatic beta-cell that can account for these multimodal patterns. The model includes the feedback of cytosolic Ca2+ onto ion channels that can account for bursting, and a metabolic subsystem that is capable of producing slow oscillations driven by oscillations in glycolysis. This slow rhythm is responsible for the slow mode of compound bursting in the model. We also show that it is possible for glycolytic oscillations alone to drive a very slow form of bursting, which we call "glycolytic bursting." Finally, the model predicts that there is bistability between stationary and oscillatory glycolysis for a range of parameter values. We provide experimental support for this model prediction. Overall, the model can account for a diversity of islet behaviors described in the literature over the past 20 years.},

	Abstract = {For the first 10 days of pregnancy and the first 12 days of pseudopregnancy, the secretion of prolactin (PRL) from pituitary lactotrophs is rhythmic, with two surges/day. This rhythm can also be triggered by bolus injection of oxytocin (OT). We describe a mathematical model for the initiation, maintenance, and termination of the OT-induced PRL rhythm. In our model, the mechanism for this circadian rhythm is mutual interaction between lactotrophs and neuroendocrine dopamine (DA) neurons. This rhythm is, under normal lighting conditions, entrained by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but persists in the absence of input from the SCN. We postulate that OT injection triggers the rhythm by activating a population of bistable hypothalamic neurons that innervate and inhibit DA neurons. The bistable nature of these neurons allows them to act as a memory device, maintaining the rhythm long after OT has been cleared from the blood. The mechanism for this memory device and the arguments supporting it are detailed with computer simulations. Finally, we consider potential targets for a rhythm-terminating factor and make predictions that may be used to determine which mechanism is operational in terminating the OT- or mating-induced PRL rhythm.},

	Abstract = {Insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells is oscillatory, with a typical period of 2-7 min, reflecting oscillations in membrane potential and the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. Our central hypothesis is that the slow 2-7 min oscillations are due to glycolytic oscillations, whereas faster oscillations that are superimposed are due to Ca(2+) feedback onto metabolism or ion channels. We extend a previous mathematical model based on this hypothesis to include a more detailed description of mitochondrial metabolism. We demonstrate that this model can account for typical oscillatory patterns of membrane potential and Ca(2+) concentration in islets. It also accounts for temporal data on oxygen consumption in islets. A recent challenge to the notion that glycolytic oscillations drive slow Ca(2+) oscillations in islets are data showing that oscillations in Ca(2+), mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and NAD(P)H levels are all terminated by membrane hyperpolarization. We demonstrate that these data are in fact compatible with a model in which glycolytic oscillations are the key player in rhythmic islet activity. Finally, we use the model to address the recent finding that the activity of islets from some mice is uniformly fast, whereas that from islets of other mice is slow. We propose a mechanism for this dichotomy.},

Great advances have been made in this area, but the mechanisms underlying the pulsatility of insulin secretion remain controversial. The period of these pulses is 4-6 min and reflects oscillations in islet membrane potential and intracellular free Ca(2+). Pulsatile blood insulin levels appear to play an important physiological role in insulin action and are lost in patients with type 2 diabetes and their near relatives. We present evidence for a recently developed beta-cell model, the "dual oscillator model," in which oscillations in activity are due to both electrical and metabolic mechanisms. This model is capable of explaining much of the available data on islet activity and offers possible resolutions of a number of longstanding issues. The model, however, still lacks direct confirmation and raises new issues. In this article, we highlight both the successes of the model and the challenges that it poses for the field.},

	Abstract = {Oscillations are an integral part of insulin secretion and are ultimately due to oscillations in the electrical activity of pancreatic beta-cells, called bursting. In this chapter we discuss islet bursting oscillations and a unified biophysical model for this multi-scale behavior. We describe how electrical bursting is related to oscillations in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration within beta-cells and the role played by metabolic oscillations. Finally, we discuss two potential mechanisms for the synchronization of islets within the pancreas. Some degree of synchronization must occur, since distinct oscillations in insulin levels have been observed in hepatic portal blood and in peripheral blood sampling of rats, dogs, and humans. Our central hypothesis, supported by several lines of evidence, is that insulin oscillations are crucial to normal glucose homeostasis. Disturbance of oscillations, either at the level of the individual islet or at the level of islet synchronization, is detrimental and can play a major role in type 2 diabetes.},

	Abstract = {Release of calcium from intracellular stores occurs by two pathways, an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated channel and a calcium-gated channel (ryanodine receptor). Using specific antibodies, both receptors were found in Purkinje cells of cerebellum. We have now compared the functional properties of the channels corresponding to the two receptors by incorporating endoplasmic reticulum vesicles from canine cerebellum into planar bilayers. InsP3-gated channels were observed most frequently. Another channel type was activated by adenine nucleotides or caffeine, inhibited by ruthenium red, and modified by ryanodine, characteristics of the ryanodine receptor/channel6. The open probability of both channel types displayed a bell-shaped curve for dependence on calcium. For the InsP3-gated channel, the maximum probability of opening occurred at 0.2 microM free calcium, with sharp decreases on either side of the maximum. Maximum activity for the ryanodine receptor/channel was maintained between 1 and 100 microM calcium. Thus, within the physiological range of cytoplasmic calcium, the InsP3-gated channel itself allows positive feedback and then negative feedback for calcium release, whereas the ryanodine receptor/channel behaves solely as a calcium-activated channel. The existence in the same cell of two channels with different responses to calcium and different ligand sensitivities provides a basis for complex patterns of intracellular calcium regulation.},

	Abstract = {The role of cytoplasmic calcium as a regulator of phospholipase C in vasopressin-activated hepatocytes was examined. According to models in which calcium spiking arises because of a positive feedback by calcium on phospholipase C, Ca2+ is seen as a positive modulator of phospholipase C under conditions of submaximal receptor activation. However, in hepatocytes whose precursor lipids had been labeled by incubation in [3H]-inositol, no increase in [3H]-(1,4,5)IP3 was detected in response to thapsigargin, in either unstimulated cells, or in cells stimulated with 1 nM vasopressin. Addition of a maximal concentration of vasopressin (1 microM) caused a rapid and substantial increase in [3H]-(1,4,5)IP3. These results indicate that changes in cytoplasmic calcium do not influence phospholipase C activity in hepatocytes, even under conditions of submaximal agonist activation. These findings also support models that provide for calcium spiking at constant levels of (1,4,5)IP3 at least in the case of the rat hepatocyte.},

	Abstract = {Plasma membranes from bovine liver contain a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity that is activated by guanine nucleotides. The G-proteins involved retained their ability to activate bovine brain PLC-beta 1 in a guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)-dependent manner following extraction from the membranes with cholate and reconstitution with phospholipids. This reconstitution assay was used to purify the G-proteins by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-Sephacel, octyl-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, Mono Q, and Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration. Gel electrophoresis showed that two alpha-subunits with molecular mass of 42 and 43 kDa were isolated to a high degree of purity, together with a beta-subunit. Neither alpha-subunit was a substrate for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Gel filtration of the final activity indicated an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa, suggesting the presence of an alpha beta gamma heterotrimer. Immunological data revealed that the 42- and 43-kDa proteins were related to alpha-subunits of the Gq class recently purified from brain (Pang, I.-H., and Sternweis, P. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18707-18712) and identified by molecular cloning (Strathmann, M., and Simon, M. I. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 9113-9117). The activation of PLC-beta 1 by the purified G-protein preparation was specific for nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotides, the efficacy decreasing in order GTP gamma S greater than guanylimidodiphosphate greater than guanylyl(beta,gamma-methylene)-diphosphonate. Half-maximal activation required 4 microM GTP gamma S suggesting that the affinity of the G-proteins for GTP analogues is low. The GTP gamma S-dependent activation of PLC-beta 1 required millimolar Mg2+ and was inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) and by excess beta gamma-subunits. Aluminum fluoride also activated PLC-beta 1 in the presence of the G-proteins. The G-proteins were inactive toward PLC-gamma 1 or PLC-delta 1. In summary, these findings identify two G-protein activators of PLC-beta 1 that have the properties of heterotrimeric G-proteins and are members of the Gq class.},

	Abstract = {The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, an ion transport protein, is expressed in the plasma membrane (PM) of virtually all animal cells. It extrudes Ca2+ in parallel with the PM ATP-driven Ca2+ pump. As a reversible transporter, it also mediates Ca2+ entry in parallel with various ion channels. The energy for net Ca2+ transport by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and its direction depend on the Na+, Ca2+, and K+ gradients across the PM, the membrane potential, and the transport stoichiometry. In most cells, three Na+ are exchanged for one Ca2+. In vertebrate photoreceptors, some neurons, and certain other cells, K+ is transported in the same direction as Ca2+, with a coupling ratio of four Na+ to one Ca2+ plus one K+. The exchanger kinetics are affected by nontransported Ca2+, Na+, protons, ATP, and diverse other modulators. Five genes that code for the exchangers have been identified in mammals: three in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3) and two in the Na+/Ca2+ plus K+ family (NCKX1 and NCKX2). Genes homologous to NCX1 have been identified in frog, squid, lobster, and Drosophila. In mammals, alternatively spliced variants of NCX1 have been identified; dominant expression of these variants is cell type specific, which suggests that the variations are involved in targeting and/or functional differences. In cardiac myocytes, and probably other cell types, the exchanger serves a housekeeping role by maintaining a low intracellular Ca2+ concentration; its possible role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is controversial. Cellular increases in Na+ concentration lead to increases in Ca2+ concentration mediated by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; this is important in the therapeutic action of cardiotonic steroids like digitalis. Similarly, alterations of Na+ and Ca2+ apparently modulate basolateral K+ conductance in some epithelia, signaling in some special sense organs (e.g., photoreceptors and olfactory receptors) and Ca2+-dependent secretion in neurons and in many secretory cells. The juxtaposition of PM and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum membranes may permit the PM Na+/Ca2+ exchanger to regulate sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and influence cellular Ca2+ signaling.},

Here we describe a novel approach for recording single-channel currents through recombinant InsP(3)Rs in mammalian cells that applies patch-clamp electrophysiology to nuclei isolated from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the neuronal (SII(+)) and peripheral (SII(-)) alternatively-spliced variants of the rat type 1 InsP(3)R. Single channels that were activated by InsP(3) and inhibited by heparin were observed in 45% of patches from nuclei prepared from transfected cells overexpressing recombinant InsP(3)Rs. In contrast, nuclei from cells transfected with the vector alone had InsP(3)-dependent channel activity in only 1.5% of patches. With K(+) (140 mM) as the permeant ion, recombinant SII(+) and SII(-) channels had slope conductances of 370 pS and 390 pS, respectively. The recombinant channels were 4-fold more selective for Ca(2+) over K(+), and their open probabilities were biphasically regulated by cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)]. This approach provides a powerful new methodology to study the permeation and gating properties of recombinant mammalian InsP(3)Rs in a native mammalian membrane environment at the single-channel level.},

Heparin inhibited propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves but not oscillations of [Ca2+]i. In heparin-free cells, Ca2+ waves propagated through cells displaying [Ca2+]i oscillations. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools with the Ca2+-pump inhibitor thapsigargin also inhibited the propagation of Ca2+ waves.

	Abstract = {1. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate hormone-induced subcellular Ca2+ release signals from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a prototype non-excitable cell line (HeLa cells). 2. Histamine application evoked two types of elementary Ca2+ signals: (i) Ca2+ blips arising from single ER Ca2+ release channels (amplitude, 30 nM; lateral spreading, 1.3 microns); (ii) Ca2+ puffs resulting from the concerted activation of several Ca2+ blips (amplitude, 170 nM; spreading, 4 microns). 3. Ca2+ waves in the HeLa cells arose from a variable number of initiation sites, but for individual cells, the number and subcellular location of the initiation sites were constant. The kinetics and amplitude of global Ca2+ signals were directly proportional to the number of initiation sites recruited. 4. Reduction of the feedback inherent in intracellular Ca2+ release caused saltatoric Ca2+ waves, revealing the two principal steps underlying wave propagation: diffusion and regeneration. Threshold stimulation evoked abortive Ca2+ waves, caused by the limited recruitment of Ca2+ puffs. 5. The hierarchy of Ca2+ signalling events, from fundamental levels (blips) to intermediate levels (puffs) to Ca2+ waves, is a prototype for Ca2+ signal transduction for non-excitable cells, and is also analogous to the Ca2+ quarks, Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ waves in cardiac muscle cells.},

The ability of a simple ion such as Ca(2+) to play a pivotal role in cell biology results from the facility that cells have to shape Ca(2+) signals in space, time and amplitude. To generate and interpret the variety of observed Ca(2+) signals, different cell types employ components selected from a Ca(2+) signalling 'toolkit', which comprises an array of homeostatic and sensory mechanisms. By mixing and matching components from the toolkit, cells can obtain Ca(2+) signals that suit their physiology. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of local Ca(2+) signals in defining the specificity of the interaction of Ca(2+) with its targets. Furthermore, local Ca(2+) signals are the triggers and building blocks for larger global signals that propagate throughout cells.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cyclical phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a key residue within the C-terminal domain of the activated type 5 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu₅) receptor is believed to cause the synchronous, oscillatory changes in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca²⁺ levels observed in a variety of cell types. Here, we have attempted to better define the kinase and phosphatase enzymes involved in this modulation.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Ca²⁺ and [³H]inositol phosphate ([³H]IP(x) ) measurements in astrocyte preparations have been used to evaluate the effects of pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein phosphatase activities and small interfering RNA-mediated specific PKC isoenzymic knock-down on mGlu₅ receptor signalling.
KEY RESULTS: Ca²⁺ oscillation frequency or [³H]IP(x) accumulation in astrocytes stimulated by mGlu₅ receptors, was concentration-dependently decreased by protein phosphatase-1/2A inhibition or by PKC activation. PKC inhibition also increased [³H]IP(x) accumulation two- to threefold and changed the Ca²⁺ response into a peak-plateau response. However, selective inhibition of conventional PKC isoenzymes or preventing changes in [Ca²⁺](i) concentration by BAPTA-AM loading was without effect on mGlu₅ receptor-stimulated [³H]IP(x) accumulation. Selective knock-down of PKCδ was without effect on glutamate-stimulated Ca²⁺ responses; however, selective PKCε knock-down in astrocytes changed Ca²⁺ responses from oscillatory into peak-plateau type.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These data confirm the acute regulation of mGlu₅ receptor signalling by protein kinases and protein phosphatases and provide novel data pinpointing the isoenzymic dependence of this regulation in the native mGlu₅ receptor-expressing rat cortical astrocyte. These data also highlight a potential alternative mechanism by which mGlu₅ receptor signalling might be therapeutically manipulated.},

Recent emerging evidence suggests that, in addition to carrying out various homeostatic functions within the CNS, astrocytes can also engage in a two-way dialogue with neurons. Astrocytes possess many of the receptors, and some of the ion channels, present in neurons endowing them with an ability to sense and respond to an array of neuronal signals. In addition, an expanding number of small molecules and proteins have been shown to be released by astrocytes in both health and disease. In this commentary we will highlight advances in our understanding of G protein-coupled receptor signalling in astrocytes, with a particular emphasis on metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. Discussion will focus on the major mGlu receptors expressed in astrocytes, mGlu3 and mGlu5, how these receptors can influence different aspects of astrocyte physiology, and how signalling by these G protein-coupled receptors might change under pathophysiological circumstances.},

	Abstract = {The action of different agonists such as acetylcholine on the membrane of airway smooth muscle cells may induce cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations which can be a part of the Ca(2+) signalling pathway, eventually leading to cell contraction. The aim of the present study is to present a mathematical model of the possible effect of the initial Ca(2+) distribution within the cell on the form and frequency of induced Ca(2+) oscillations. It takes into account intracellular Ca(2+) stores such as sarcoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic proteins as well as Ca(2+) exchange across the plasma membrane. We are able to demonstrate a closer agreement of model predictions with observed Ca(2+) traces for a significantly wider range of parameter values, as was previously reported. We show also that the total cellular Ca(2+) content is an important system parameter especially because of the content in sarcoplasmic reticulum. At a total Ca(2+) increase of about 20%, the oscillation frequency increases by 25%; also, damped oscillations become sustained. Cases are indicated in which such a situation could occur.},

	Abstract = {We have measured the initial propagation velocity of the sperm-induced Ca(2+) wave in the egg of Xenopus laevis and have compared it with the initial propagation velocities of the inositol triphosphate (IP(3))-induced and Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) waves. The initial mean propagation velocity of the sperm-induced wave (13 microm/s) is very similar to that of the IP(3)-induced waves (12.3 microm/s) and two times faster than the mean Ca(2+)-induced wave velocity (6.6 microm/s). We have generated realistic simulations of the fertilization wave in the frog egg using a computational technique based on the finite difference method. Modeling refinements presented here include equations for the production, degradation, and diffusion of IP(3), a description for Ca(2+) dynamics in the endoplasmic reticulum, and a highly concentrated endoplasmic reticulum in the egg cortex. We conclude that models incorporating sperm-induced IP(3) generation fit the data best and those involving the influx of either Ca(2+) or a diffusible sperm factor fit the data poorly. This independence from Ca(2+) influx is also supported by electrophysiological data indicating that Ca(2+) influx is not needed to maintain open Cl(-) channels that generate the fertilization potential.},

	Abstract = {In excitable tissues the refractory period is a critical control mechanism preventing hyperactivity and undesirable tetani, by preventing subsequent stimuli eliciting action potentials and Ca2+ entry. In ureteric smooth muscle, peristaltic waves that occur as invading pacemaker potentials produce long-lasting action potentials (300-800 ms) and extraordinarily long (more than 10 s) refractory periods, which prevent urine reflux and kidney damage. For smooth muscles neither the mechanisms underlying the refractory period nor the link between excitability and refractoriness are properly understood. Here we show that a negative feedback process, which depends on Ca2+ loading the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the action potential and on the subsequent activation of local releases of Ca2+ from the SR (sparks), stimulating plasmalemmal Ca2+-sensitive K+ (BK) channels, determines the refractory period of the action potential. As sparks gradually reduce the Ca2+ load in the SR, electrical inhibition is released, the refractory period is terminated and peristaltic contractions occur again. The refractory period can be manipulated, for example from 10 s to 100 s, by altering the Ca2+ content of the SR or release mechanism or by inhibiting BK channels. This insight into the control of excitability and hence function provides a focus for therapies directed at pathologies of smooth muscle.},

	Abstract = {Uterine contractility is generated by contractions of myometrial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that compose most of the myometrial layer of the uterine wall. Calcium ion (Ca(2+)) entry into the cell can be initiated by depolarization of the cell membrane. The increase in the free Ca(2+) concentration within the cell initiates a chain of reactions, which lead to formation of cross bridges between actin and myosin filaments, and thereby the cell contracts. During contraction the SMC shortens while it exerts forces on neighboring cells. A mathematical model of myometrial SMC contraction has been developed to study this process of excitation and contraction. The model can be used to describe the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and stress produced by the cell in response to depolarization of the cell membrane. The model accounts for the operation of three Ca(2+) control mechanisms: voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) pumps, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers. The processes of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and stress production are accounted for using the cross-bridge model of Hai and Murphy (Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 254: C99-C106, 1988) and are coupled to the Ca(2+) concentration through the rate constant of myosin phosphorylation. Measurements of Ca(2+), MLC phosphorylation, and force in contracting cells were used to set the model parameters and test its ability to predict the cell response to stimulation. The model has been used to reproduce results of voltage-clamp experiments performed in myometrial cells of pregnant rats as well as the results of simultaneous measurements of MLC phosphorylation and force production in human nonpregnant myometrial cells.},

	Abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is believed to represent the neural correlate of mammalian learning and memory function. It has been demonstrated that changes in synaptic conductance can be induced by approximately synchronous pairings of pre- and post- synaptic action potentials delivered at low frequencies. It has also been established that NMDAr-dependent calcium influx into dendritic spines represents a critical signal for plasticity induction, and can account for this spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) as well as experimental data obtained using other stimulation protocols. However, subsequent empirical studies have delineated a more complex relationship between spike-timing, firing rate, stimulus duration and post-synaptic bursting in dictating changes in the conductance of hippocampal excitatory synapses. Here, we present a detailed biophysical model of single dendritic spines on a CA1 pyramidal neuron, describe the NMDAr-dependent calcium influx generated by different stimulation protocols, and construct a parsimonious model of calcium driven kinase and phosphatase dynamics that dictate the probability of stochastic transitions between binary synaptic weight states in a Markov model. We subsequently demonstrate that this approach can account for a range of empirical observations regarding the dynamics of synaptic plasticity induced by different stimulation protocols, under regimes of pharmacological blockade and metaplasticity. Finally, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this parsimonious, unified computational synaptic plasticity model, discuss differences between the properties of cortical and hippocampal plasticity highlighted by the experimental literature, and the manner in which further empirical and theoretical research might elucidate the cellular basis of mammalian learning and memory function.},

	Abstract = {1. The activation of elementary calcium release events ('puffs') and their co-ordination to generate calcium waves was studied in Xenopus oocytes by confocal linescan imaging together with photorelease of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) from a caged precursor. 2. Weak photolysis flashes evoked no responses or isolated calcium puffs, whereas flashes of increasing strength evoked more frequent puffs, often occurring in flurries as abortive waves, and then a near-simultaneous calcium liberation originating at multiple sites. The numbers of sites activated increased initially as about the fourth power of photoreleased [InsP3]. 3. Following repeated, identical photolysis flashes, puffs arose after stochastically varying latencies of a few hundred milliseconds to several seconds. The cumulative number of events initially increased as about the third power of time. No rise in free [Ca2+] was detected preceding the puffs, suggesting that this co-operativity arises through binding of multiple InsP3 molecules, rather than through calcium feedback. 4. The mean latency to onset of calcium liberation shortened as about the square of the flash strength, and the dispersion in latencies between events reduced correspondingly. 5. Weak stimuli often evoked coupled puffs involving adjacent sites, and stronger flashes evoked saltatory calcium waves, propagating with non-constant velocity. During waves, [Ca2+] rose slowly between puff sites, but more abruptly at active sites following an initial diffusive rise in calcium. 6. Initial rates of rise of local [Ca2+] at release sites were similar during puffs and release induced by much (> 10-fold) greater [InsP3]. In contrast, macroscopic calcium measurements averaged over the scan line showed a graded dependence of rate of calcium liberation upon [InsP3], due to recruitment of additional sites and decreasing dispersion in activation latencies. 7. We conclude that the initiation of calcium liberation depends co-operatively upon [InsP3] whereas the subsequent regenerative increase in calcium flux depends upon local calcium feedback and is largely independent of [InsP3]. Wave propagation is consistent with the diffusive spread of calcium evoking regenerative liberation at heterogeneous discrete sites, the sensitivity of which is primed by InsP3.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism that links membrane potential changes to the release of calcium from internal stores to cause contraction of cardiac cells is unclear. By using the calcium indicator fura-2 under voltage-clamp conditions, changes in intracellular calcium could be monitored in single rat ventricular cells while controlling membrane potential. The voltage dependence of the depolarization-induced increase in intracellular calcium was not the same as that of the calcium current (Isi), which suggests that only a small fraction of Isi is required to trigger calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release may be partly regulated by membrane potential, since repolarization could terminate the rise in intracellular calcium. Thus, changes in the action potential will have immediate effects on the time course of the calcium transient beyond those associated with its effects on Isi.},

	Abstract = {Computer simulations were used to examine the response of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to the sarcolemmal calcium influx via L-type calcium channels (DHPRs). The effects of ryanodine receptor organization, diad geometry, DHPR single-channel current, and DHPR gating were examined. In agreement with experimental findings, the simulations showed that RyRs can respond rapidly (approximately 0.4 ms) to calcium influx via DHPRs. The responsiveness of the RyR depends on the geometrical arrangement between the RyRs and the DHPR in the diad, with wider diads being generally less responsive. When the DHPR single-channel current is small (approximately 25 fA), the organization of RyRs into small clusters results in an improved responsiveness. With experimentally observed DHPR mean open and closed times (0.17 ms and 4 ms, respectively) it is the first opening of the DHPR that is most likely to activate the RyR. A measure of the efficiency (Q) by which DHPR gating evokes sarcoplasmic reticulum release is defined. Q is at maximum for tau approximately 0.3 ms, and we interpret this finding in terms of the "tuning" of DHPR gating to RyR response. If certain cardiac myopathies are associated with a mismatch in the "tuning," then modification of DHPR gating with drugs to "retune" calcium-induced calcium release should be possible.},

	Abstract = {The factors responsible for the regulation of regenerative calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) during Ca(2+) spark evolution remain unclear. Cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR) gating in rats and sheep was recorded at physiological Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and ATP levels and incorporated into a 3D model of the cardiac dyad, which reproduced the time course of Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) blinks, and Ca(2+) spark restitution. The termination of CICR by induction decay in the model principally arose from the steep Ca(2+) dependence of RyR closed time, with the measured sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) lumen Ca(2+) dependence of RyR gating making almost no contribution. The start of CICR termination was strongly dependent on the extent of local depletion of junctional SR Ca(2+), as well as the time course of local Ca(2+) gradients within the junctional space. Reducing the dimensions of the dyad junction reduced Ca(2+) spark amplitude by reducing the strength of regenerative feedback within CICR. A refractory period for Ca(2+) spark initiation and subsequent Ca(2+) spark amplitude restitution arose from 1), the extent to which the regenerative phase of CICR can be supported by the partially depleted junctional SR, and 2), the availability of releasable Ca(2+) in the junctional SR. The physical organization of RyRs within the junctional space had minimal effects on Ca(2+) spark amplitude when more than nine RyRs were present. Spark amplitude had a nonlinear dependence on RyR single-channel Ca(2+) flux, and was approximately halved by reducing the flux from 0.6 to 0.2 pA. Although rat and sheep RyRs had quite different Ca(2+) sensitivities, Ca(2+) spark amplitude was hardly affected. This suggests that moderate changes in RyR gating by second-messenger systems will principally alter the spatiotemporal properties of SR release, with smaller effects on the amount released.},

	Abstract = {Calcium puffs are local transient Ca(2+) releases from internal Ca(2+) stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Such release occurs through a cluster of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Based on the IP3R model (which is determined by fitting to stationary single-channel data) and nonstationary single-channel data, we construct a new IP3R model that includes time-dependent rates of mode switches. A point-source model of Ca(2+) puffs is then constructed based on the new IP3R model and is solved by a hybrid Gillespie method with adaptive timing. Model results show that a relatively slow recovery of an IP3R from Ca(2+) inhibition is necessary to reproduce most of the experimental outcomes, especially the nonexponential interpuff interval distributions. The number of receptors in a cluster could be severely underestimated when the recovery is sufficiently slow. Furthermore, we find that, as the number of IP3Rs increases, the average duration of puffs initially increases but then becomes saturated, whereas the average decay time keeps increasing linearly. This gives rise to the observed asymmetric puff shape.},

	Abstract = {The inositol trisphosphate receptor ([Formula: see text]) is one of the most important cellular components responsible for oscillations in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration. Over the past decade, two major questions about the [Formula: see text] have arisen. Firstly, how best should the [Formula: see text] be modeled? In other words, what fundamental properties of the [Formula: see text] allow it to perform its function, and what are their quantitative properties? Secondly, although calcium oscillations are caused by the stochastic opening and closing of small numbers of [Formula: see text], is it possible for a deterministic model to be a reliable predictor of calcium behavior? Here, we answer these two questions, using airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) as a specific example. Firstly, we show that periodic calcium waves in ASMC, as well as the statistics of calcium puffs in other cell types, can be quantitatively reproduced by a two-state model of the [Formula: see text], and thus the behavior of the [Formula: see text] is essentially determined by its modal structure. The structure within each mode is irrelevant for function. Secondly, we show that, although calcium waves in ASMC are generated by a stochastic mechanism, [Formula: see text] stochasticity is not essential for a qualitative prediction of how oscillation frequency depends on model parameters, and thus deterministic [Formula: see text] models demonstrate the same level of predictive capability as do stochastic models. We conclude that, firstly, calcium dynamics can be accurately modeled using simplified [Formula: see text] models, and, secondly, to obtain qualitative predictions of how oscillation frequency depends on parameters it is sufficient to use a deterministic model.},

	Abstract = {An experiment performed in London nearly 120 years ago, which by today's standards would be considered unacceptably sloppy, marked the beginning of the calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling saga. Sidney Ringer [Ringer, S. (1883) J. Physiol. 4, 29-43] was studying the contraction of isolated rat hearts. In earlier experiments, Ringer had suspended them in a saline medium for which he admitted to having used London tap water, which is hard: The hearts contracted beautifully. When he proceeded to replace the tap water with distilled water, he made a startling finding: The beating of the hearts became progressively weaker, and stopped altogether after about 20 min. To maintain contraction, he found it necessary to add Ca(2+) salts to the suspension medium. Thus, Ringer had serendipitously discovered that Ca(2+), hitherto exclusively considered as a structural element, was active in a tissue that has nothing to do with bone or teeth, and performed there a completely novel function: It carried the signal that initiated heart contraction. It was a landmark observation, which should have immediately aroused wide interest. Unexpectedly, however, for decades it attracted no particular attention. Occasionally, farsighted pioneers argued forcefully for a messenger role of Ca(2+), offering compelling experimental evidence. Among them, one could quote L. V. Heilbrunn [Heilbrunn, L. V. (1940) Physiol. Zool. 13, 88-94], who contracted frog muscle fibers by applying Ca(2+) salts to their cut ends, but not to their surfaces. Heilbrunn correctly concluded that Ca(2+) had diffused from the cut ends to the internal contractile elements to elicit their contraction. One could also quote K. Bailey [Bailey, K. (1942) Biochem. J. 36, 121-139], who showed that the ATPase activity of myosin was strongly activated by Ca(2+) (but not by Mg(2+)), and concluded that the liberation of Ca(2+) in the neighborhood of the myosin controlled muscle contraction. Clearly, enough evidence was there, but only a handful of people had the vision to see it and to foresee its far-reaching implications. Perhaps no better example of clairvoyance can be offered than the quip by O. Loewy in 1959: "Ja Kalzium, das ist alles!"},

However, contributions had already appeared in the 1950s showing - albeit indirectly - that isolated mitochondria bound Ca(2+) actively. Somehow, however, these contributions failed to attract the attention that they undoubtedly deserved. The 1961-1962 findings started the ball rolling, initiating a topic that was to have a peculiar oscillatory history.

	Abstract = {Voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels mediate Ca(2+) entry into cells in response to membrane depolarization. Electrophysiological studies reveal different Ca(2+) currents designated L-, N-, P-, Q-, R-, and T-type. The high-voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels that have been characterized biochemically are complexes of a pore-forming alpha1 subunit of approximately 190-250 kDa; a transmembrane, disulfide-linked complex of alpha2 and delta subunits; an intracellular beta subunit; and in some cases a transmembrane gamma subunit. Ten alpha1 subunits, four alpha2delta complexes, four beta subunits, and two gamma subunits are known. The Cav1 family of alpha1 subunits conduct L-type Ca(2+) currents, which initiate muscle contraction, endocrine secretion, and gene transcription, and are regulated primarily by second messenger-activated protein phosphorylation pathways. The Cav2 family of alpha1 subunits conduct N-type, P/Q-type, and R-type Ca(2+) currents, which initiate rapid synaptic transmission and are regulated primarily by direct interaction with G proteins and SNARE proteins and secondarily by protein phosphorylation. The Cav3 family of alpha1 subunits conduct T-type Ca(2+) currents, which are activated and inactivated more rapidly and at more negative membrane potentials than other Ca(2+) current types. The distinct structures and patterns of regulation of these three families of Ca(2+) channels provide a flexible array of Ca(2+) entry pathways in response to changes in membrane potential and a range of possibilities for regulation of Ca(2+) entry by second messenger pathways and interacting proteins.},

	Abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium (Ca(2+)) channels are key transducers of membrane potential changes into intracellular Ca(2+) transients that initiate many physiological events. There are ten members of the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel family in mammals, and they serve distinct roles in cellular signal transduction. The Ca(V)1 subfamily initiates contraction, secretion, regulation of gene expression, integration of synaptic input in neurons, and synaptic transmission at ribbon synapses in specialized sensory cells. The Ca(V)2 subfamily is primarily responsible for initiation of synaptic transmission at fast synapses. The Ca(V)3 subfamily is important for repetitive firing of action potentials in rhythmically firing cells such as cardiac myocytes and thalamic neurons. This article presents the molecular relationships and physiological functions of these Ca(2+) channel proteins and provides information on their molecular, genetic, physiological, and pharmacological properties.},

@article{chad1984a,
	Abstract = {Ca currents flowing during voltage-clamp depolarizations were examined in axotomized Aplysia neurones under conditions that virtually eliminated other currents. Moderate to large currents exhibited a two-component time course of relaxation that can be approximated reasonably well by the sum of two exponentials. The rapid phase (tau 1 approximately equal to 70 ms at 0 mV) plus the slower phase (tau 2 approximately equal to 300 ms at 0 mV) ride upon a steady, non-inactivating current, I infinity. Conditions that diminish the peak current amplitude, such as reduced stimulus depolarization, inactivation remaining from a prior depolarization, or partial blockade of the Ca conductance by Cd, slowed both phases of inactivation, and all selectively eliminated the tau 1 phase, such that weak currents exhibited only the slower phase of decline. Injection of EGTA slowed both phases of inactivation, decreased the extent of the tau 1 phase, and increased the intensity of I infinity and of the current during the tau 2 phase. For a given voltage, the rate of inactivation increased as the peak current strength was increased, and decreased as the peak current strength was decreased. For a given peak current the rate of inactivation decreased as depolarization was increased. The relation of inactivation to prior Ca2+ entry was essentially linear for small currents, but decreased in slope with time during strong currents. The relation also became shallower with increasing depolarization, suggesting an apparent decrease in the efficacy of Ca in causing inactivation at more positive potentials. The basic kinetics of Ca current inactivation along with experimentally induced changes in those kinetics were simulated with a binding-site model in which inactivation develops during current flow as a function of the entry and accumulation of free Ca2+. This demonstrated that a single Ca-mediated process can account for the two-component time course of inactivation, and that the nearly bi-exponential shape need not arise from two separate processes. The two-component time course emerges as a consequence of a postulated hyperbolic reaction between diminishing probability of channels remaining open and the accumulation of intracellular free Ca2+. The occurrence of a single- or a two-component time course of inactivation thus appears to depend on the levels of internal free Ca2+ traversed during current flow.},

	Abstract = {'Wash-out' and inactivation of the Ca current were examined in dialysed, voltage-clamped neurones of Helix aspersa under conditions that isolate the Ca current virtually free of other currents. EGTA or other internal Ca2+ chelators were routinely omitted from the dialysate. The time-dependent loss, or wash-out, of Ca current was slowed by addition to the dialysing solution of agents, such as dibutyryl adenosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP), Mg adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and the catalytic subunit of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase, that promote protein phosphorylation and by EGTA. However, neither the phosphorylation-promoting agents nor internal EGTA prevented wash-out entirely, nor did they significantly restore previously 'washed-out' current. With phosphorylating agents in the dialysing solution, the irreversible development of wash-out was greatly reduced by introduction of leupeptin, an inhibitor of protease activity. Thus, the irreversible component of wash-out appears to result from a Ca-dependent proteolytic process. In the presence of leupeptin alone, Ca current amplitude continued to decline: however, the current could be largely or fully restored with addition of catalytic subunit, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and Mg ATP to the dialysing solution. Thus, inhibition of proteolysis revealed a reversible component of wash-out that appears to result from dephosphorylation. During perfusion with leupeptin, Mg ATP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and catalytic subunit the Ca current remained stable for up to several hours without addition of internal Ca2+ buffer. The rate of inactivation of the current that occurs during a depolarizing step showed only a very gradual decline during this time. Under these conditions, perfusion with calcineurin, a Ca-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, caused a significant increase in the rate of Ca current inactivation. This inactivation was virtually eliminated by introduction of EGTA or by replacement of external Ca2+ with Ba2+, which is consistent with the ion dependency for calmodulin-dependent activation of calcineurin. When ATP in the dialysate was replaced with ATP-gamma-S (adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate], an analogue that donates a thiophosphate group resistant to hydrolysis, the rate of inactivation slowed. Since Ca-dependent inactivation during step depolarizations is enhanced by conditions that promote dephosphorylation, and Ca current wash-out is slowed by conditions that promote phosphorylation, inactivation and reversible wash-out appear to be related.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Similar communicated Ca2+ responses occurred in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, despite an initial decrease in [Ca2+]i in the stimulated cell. Mechanical stimulation in the presence of glutamate induced a typical communicated Ca2+ wave through cells undergoing asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations in response to glutamate. The coexistence of communicated Ca2+ waves and asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations suggests distinct mechanisms for intra- and intercellular Ca2+ signaling.

	Abstract = {Calcium signaling in C6 glioma cells in culture was examined with digital fluorescence video microscopy. C6 cells express low levels of the gap junction protein connexin43 and have correspondingly weak gap junctional communication as evidenced by dye coupling (Naus, C. C. G., J. F. Bechberger, S. Caveney, and J. X. Wilson. 1991. Neurosci. Lett. 126:33-36). Transfection of C6 cells with the cDNA encoding connexin43 resulted in clones with increased expression of connexin43 mRNA and protein and increased dye coupling, as well as markedly reduced rates of proliferation (Zhu, D., S. Caveney, G. M. Kidder, and C. C. Naus. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:1883-1887; Naus, C. C. G., D. Zhu, S. Todd, and G. M. Kidder. 1992. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 12:163-175). Mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a culture of non-transfected C6 cells induced a wave of increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that showed little or no communication to adjacent cells. By contrast, mechanical stimulation of a single cell in cultures of C6 clones expressing transfected connexin43 cDNA induced a Ca2+ wave that was communicated to multiple surrounding cells, and the extent of communication was proportional to the level of expression of the connexin43 cDNA. These results provide direct evidence that intercellular Ca2+ signaling occurs via gap junctions. Ca2+ signaling through gap junctions may provide a means for the coordinated regulation of cellular function, including cell growth and differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Agonist-induced Ca2+ oscillations in rat hepatocytes involve the production of myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which stimulates the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The oscillatory frequency is conditioned by the agonist concentration. This study investigated the role of IP3 concentration in the modulation of oscillatory frequency by using microinjected photolabile IP3 analogs. Photorelease of IP3 during hormone-induced oscillations evoked a Ca2+ spike, after which oscillations resumed with a delay corresponding to the period set by the agonists. IP3 photorelease had no influence on the frequency of oscillations. After photorelease of 1-(alpha-glycerophosphoryl)-D-myo-inositol-4,5-diphosphate (GPIP2), a slowly metabolized IP3 analog, the frequency of oscillations initially increased by 34% and declined to its original level within approximately 6 min. Both IP3 and GPIP2 effects can be explained by their rate of degradation: the half-life of IP3, which is a few seconds, can account for the lack of influence of IP3 photorelease on the frequency, whereas the slower metabolism of GPIP2 allowed a transient acceleration of the oscillations. The phase shift introduced by IP3 is likely the result of the brief elevation of Ca2+ during spiking that resets the IP3 receptor to a state of maximum inactivation. A mathematical model of Ca2+ oscillations is in satisfactory agreement with the observed results.},

	Abstract = {Recent experiments indicate that the calcium store (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum) is involved in electrical bursting and [Ca2+]i oscillation in bursting neuronal cells. In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model for bursting neurons, which includes Ca2+ in the intracellular Ca2+ stores and a voltage-independent calcium channel (VICC). This VICC is activated by a depletion of Ca2+ concentration in the store, [Ca2+]cs. In this model, [Ca2+]cs oscillates slowly, and this slow dynamic in turn gives rise to electrical bursting. The newly formulated model thus is radically different from existing models of bursting excitable cells, whose mechanism owes its origin to the ion channels in the plasma membrane and the [Ca2+]i dynamics. In addition, this model is capable of providing answers to some puzzling phenomena, which the previous models could not (e.g., why cAMP, glucagon, and caffeine have ability to change the burst periodicity). Using mag-fura-2 fluorescent dyes, it would be interesting to verify the prediction of the model that (1) [Ca2+]cs oscillates in bursting neurons such as Aplysia neuron and (2) the neurotransmitters and hormones that affect the adenylate cyclase pathway can influence this oscillation.},

	Abstract = {It is shown in this paper that electrical bursting and the oscillations in the intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, observed in excitable cells such as pancreatic beta-cells and R-15 cells of the mollusk Aplysia may be driven by a slow oscillation of the calcium concentration in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, [Ca2+]lum. This hypothesis follows from the inclusion of the dynamic changes of [Ca2+]lum in the Chay bursting model. This extended model provides answers to some puzzling phenomena, such as why isolated single pancreatic beta-cells burst with a low frequency while intact beta-cells in an islet burst with a much higher frequency. Verification of the model prediction that [Ca2+]lum is a primary oscillator which drives electrical bursting and [Ca2+]i oscillations in these cells awaits experimental testing. Experiments using fluorescent dyes such as mag-fura-2-AM or aequorin could provide relevant information.},

By incorporating a low-threshold transient inward current to the store-operated bursting model of Chay, this paper elucidates the role of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration in influencing electrical activity, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and the luminal Ca2+ concentration in the intracellular Ca2+ store. The possibility that this inward current is a carbachol-sensitive and TTX-insensitive Na+ current discovered by others is discussed.

	Abstract = {Ions enter cells through pores in proteins that are holes in dielectrics. The energy of interaction between ion and charge induced on the dielectric is many kT, and so the dielectric properties of channel and pore are important. We describe ionic movement by (three-dimensional) Nemst-Planck equations (including flux and net charge). Potential is described by Poisson&apos;s equation in the pore and Laplace&apos;s equation in the channel wall, allowing induced but not permanent charge. Asymptotic expansions are constructed exploiting the long narrow shape of the pore and the relatively high dielectric constant of the pore&apos;s contents. The resulting one-dimensional equations can be integrated numerically; they can be analyzed when channels are short or long (compared with the Debye length). Traditional constant field equations are derived if the induced charge is small, e.g., if the channel is short or if the total concentration gradient is zero. A constant gradient of concentration is derived if the channel is long. Plots directly comparable to experiments are given of current vs voltage, reversal potential vs. concentration, and slope conductance vs. concentration. This dielectric theory can easily be tested: its parameters can be determined by traditional constant field measurements. The dielectric theory then predicts current-voltage relations quite different from constant field, usually more linear, when gradients of total concentration are imposed. Numerical analysis shows that the interaction of ion and channel can be described by a mean potential if, but only if, the induced charge is negligible, that is to say, the electric field is spatially constant.},

	Abstract = {Ions crossing biological membranes are described as a concentration of charge flowing through a selective open channel of one conformation and analyzed by a combination of Poisson and Nernst-Planck equations and boundary conditions, called the PNP theory for short. The ion fluxes in this theory interact much as ion fluxes interact in biological channels and mediated transporters, provided the theoretical channel contains permanent charge and has selectivity created by (electro-chemical) resistance at its ends. Interaction occurs because the flux of different ionic species depends on the same electric field. That electric field is a variable, changing with experimental conditions because the screening (i.e., shielding) of the permanent charge within the channel changes with experimental conditions. For example, the screening of charge and the shape of the electric field depend on the concentration of all ionic species on both sides of the channel. As experimental interventions vary the screening, the electric field varies, and thus the flux of each ionic species varies conjointly, and is, in that sense, coupled. Interdependence and interaction are the rule, independence is the exception, in this channel.},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic beta-cells maintain glucose homeostasis by their regulated Ca(2+)-dependent secretion of insulin. Several cellular mechanisms control intracellular Ca(2+) levels, but their relative significance in mouse beta-cells is not fully known. We used photometry to measure the dynamics of cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) clearance after brief, depolarization-induced Ca(2+) entry. Treatment with thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid, inhibitors of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pumps, nearly doubled the peak and slowed the decay of the depolarization-induced Ca(2+) transients. The remaining thapsigargin-insensitive decay was slowed further by inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) and plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) via alkalization of the bath solution, by adding lanthanum, or by substitution of Na(+) with Li(+). Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake contributed little to clearance in thapsigargin-pretreated cells. Together, the SERCA, PMCA, and NCX transport mechanisms accounted for 89 to 97% of clearance in normal solutions. We developed a quantitative model for the dynamic role of removal mechanisms over a wide range of [Ca(2+)](i). According to our model, 50 to 64% of initial Ca(2+) removal is via the SERCA pump, whereas the NCX contributes 21-30% of the extrusion at high [Ca(2+)](i), and the PMCA contributes 21-27% at low [Ca(2+)](i).},

In combination with De Young-Keizer-Li-Rinzel model, we successfully reproduce a sustained Ca(2+) oscillation in cytoplasm. Our results reveal that Ca(2+) oscillation dynamics in cytoplasm can be significantly affected by the way how the Orai1 CRAC channel are assembled and activated. A low sustained Ca(2+) influx is observed through the CRAC channels across the plasma membrane. In particular, our model shows that a tetrameric channel complex can effectively regulate the total quantity of the channels and the ratio of the active channels to the total channels, and a period of Ca(2+) oscillation about 29 s is in agreement with published experimental data. The bifurcation analyses illustrate the different dynamic properties between our mixed Ca(2+) feedback model and the single positive or negative feedback models.},

	Abstract = {A kinetic model for insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells is adapted from a model for fast exocytosis in chromaffin cells. The fusion of primed granules with the plasma membrane is assumed to occur only in the "microdomain" near voltage-sensitive L-type Ca(2+)-channels, where [Ca(2+)] can reach micromolar levels. In contrast, resupply and priming of granules are assumed to depend on the cytosolic [Ca(2+)]. Adding a two-compartment model to handle the temporal distribution of Ca(2+) between the microdomain and the cytosol, we obtain a unified model that can generate both the fast granule fusion and the slow insulin secretion found experimentally in response to a step of membrane potential. The model can simulate the potentiation induced in islets by preincubation with glucose and the reduction in second-phase insulin secretion induced by blocking R-type Ca(2+)-channels (Ca(V)2.3). The model indicates that increased second-phase insulin secretion induced by the amplifying signal is controlled by the "resupply" step of the exocytosis cascade. In contrast, enhancement of priming is a good candidate for amplification of first-phase secretion by glucose, cyclic adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and protein kinase C. Finally, insulin secretion is enhanced when the amplifying signal oscillates in phase with the triggering Ca(2+)-signal.},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are hypothalamic neurons that control the pulsatile release of GnRH that governs fertility and reproduction in mammals. The mechanisms underlying the pulsatile release of GnRH are not well understood. Some mathematical models have been developed previously to explain different aspects of these activities, such as the properties of burst action potential firing and their associated Ca(2+) transients. These previous studies were based on experimental recordings taken from the soma of GnRH neurons. However, some research groups have shown that the dendrites of GnRH neurons play very important roles. In particular, it is now known that the site of action potential initiation in these neurons is often in the dendrite, over 100 μm from the soma. This raises an important question. Since some of the mechanisms for controlling the burst length and interburst interval are located in the soma, how can electrical bursting be controlled when initiated at a site located some distance from these controlling mechanisms? In order to answer this question, we construct a spatio-temporal mathematical model that includes both the soma and the dendrite. Our model shows that the diffusion coefficient for the spread of electrical potentials in the dendrite is large enough to coordinate burst firing of action potentials when the initiation site is located at some distance from the soma.},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons have two major processes that have properties of both dendrites (they receive synaptic input from other neurons) and axons (they actively propagate action potentials to the synaptic terminal). These processes have thus been termed dendrons. We construct a stochastic spatiotemporal model of the dendron of the GnRH neuron, with the goal of studying how stochastic synaptic input along the length of the dendron affects the initiation and propagation of action potentials. We show (1) that synaptic inputs closer to the soma are effective controllers of action potential initiation and electrical bursting and (2) that although the effects on the amplitude and width of propagating action potentials are critically dependent on the timing and location of synaptic input addition, the effects remain small. We conclude that although stochastic synaptic input along the length of the dendron is likely to be a major determinant of action potential initiation, it is an unlikely mechanism for controlling whether or not action potentials reach the synaptic terminal. Thus, the role of synaptic inputs situated along the dendron a long way from the site of action potential initiation remains unclear. We also show that the actions of kisspeptin can result in significant modulation of the amount of calcium released by an action potential at the synaptic terminal. Furthermore, we show that the actions of kisspeptin are greatest when multiple effects operate together and that a kisspeptin-induced increase in firing rate is, by itself, less effective at increasing [Formula: see text] release than is a combination of an increased firing rate, an increase in [Formula: see text] influx, and an increase in inositol trisphosphate ([Formula: see text]) production. We conclude that the inherent synergies in the various actions of kisspeptin make it a likely candidate for the precise control of [Formula: see text] transients at the synaptic terminal.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous local increases in the concentration of intracellular calcium, called "calcium sparks," were detected in quiescent rat heart cells with a laser scanning confocal microscope and the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3. Estimates of calcium flux associated with the sparks suggest that calcium sparks result from spontaneous openings of single sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium-release channels, a finding supported by ryanodine-dependent changes of spark kinetics. At resting intracellular calcium concentrations, these SR calcium-release channels had a low rate of opening (approximately 0.0001 per second). An increase in the calcium content of the SR, however, was associated with a fourfold increase in opening rate and resulted in some sparks triggering propagating waves of increased intracellular calcium concentration. The calcium spark is the consequence of elementary events underlying excitation-contraction coupling and provides an explanation for both spontaneous and triggered changes in the intracellular calcium concentration in the mammalian heart.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Voltage-gated (Cav) Ca2+ channels are multi-subunit complexes that play diverse roles in a wide variety of tissues. A fundamental mechanism controlling Cav channel function involves the Ca2+ ions that permeate the channel pore. Ca2+ influx through Cav channels mediates feedback regulation to the channel that is both negative (Ca2+-dependent inactivation, CDI) and positive (Ca2+-dependent facilitation, CDF).
SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review highlights general mechanisms of CDI and CDF with an emphasis on how these processes have been studied electrophysiologically in native and heterologous expression systems.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological analyses have led to detailed insights into the mechanisms and prevalence of CDI and CDF as Cav channel regulatory mechanisms. All Cav channel family members undergo some form of Ca2+-dependent feedback that relies on CaM or a related Ca2+ binding protein. Tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the role of CaM in CDI and CDF. Yet, what contributes to the heterogeneity of CDI/CDF in various cell-types and how Ca2+-dependent regulation of Cav channels controls Ca2+ signaling remain largely unexplored.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Ca2+ influx through Cav channels regulates diverse physiological events including excitation-contraction coupling in muscle, neurotransmitter and hormone release, and Ca2+-dependent gene transcription. Therefore, the mechanisms that regulate channels, such as CDI and CDF, can have a large impact on the signaling potential of excitable cells in various physiological contexts.

	Abstract = {Glycogenolytic agonists induce coordinated Ca(2+) oscillations in multicellular rat hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The coordination of intercellular Ca(2+) signals requires functional gap-junction coupling. The mechanisms ensuring this coordination are not precisely known. We investigated possible roles of Ca(2+) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) as a coordinating messengers for Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes. Application of ionomycin or of supra-maximal concentrations of agonists show that Ca(2+) does not significantly diffuse between connected hepatocytes, although gap junctions ensure the passage of small signaling molecules, as demonstrated by FRAP experiments. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes can be favored by a rise in the level of InsP(3), via the increase of agonist concentrations, or by a shift in the affinity of InsP(3) receptor for InsP(3). In the same line, coordination cannot be achieved if the InsP(3) is rapidly metabolized by InsP(3)-phosphatase in one cell of the multiplet. These results demonstrate that even if small amounts of Ca(2+) diffuse across gap junctions, they most probably do not play a significant role in inducing a coordinated Ca(2+) signal among connected hepatocytes. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) oscillations is fully dependent on the diffusion of InsP(3) between neighboring cells.},

Cells were treated with thapsigargin to inhibit Ca2+ accumulation by SERCA pumps and depolarized to elevate [Ca2+(i); the recovery that followed repolarization was then examined. The total Ca2+ flux responsible for the [Ca2+](i) recovery was separated into mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial components based on sensitivity to the proton ionophore FCCP, a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in these cells. The nonmitochondrial flux, representing net Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane, has a simple dependence on [Ca2+](i), while the net mitochondrial flux (J(mito)) is biphasic, indicative of Ca+) accumulation during the initial phase of recovery when [Ca2+](i) is high, and net Ca2+ release during later phases of recovery. During each phase, mitochondrial Ca2+ transport has distinct effects on recovery kinetics. J(mito) was separated into components representing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release based on sensitivity to the specific mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor, CGP 37157 (CGP). The CGP-resistant (uptake) component of J(mito) increases steeply with [Ca2+](i), as expected for transport by the mitochondrial uniporter. The CGP-sensitive (release) component is inhibited by lowering the intracellular Na(+) concentration and depends on both intra- and extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration, as expected for the Na(+)/Ca2+ exchanger. Above approximately 400 nM [Ca2+](i), net mitochondrial Ca2+ transport is dominated by uptake and is largely insensitive to CGP. When [Ca2+](i) is approximately 200-300 nM, the net mitochondrial flux is small but represents the sum of much larger uptake and release fluxes that largely cancel. Thus, mitochondrial Ca2+ transport occurs in situ at much lower concentrations than previously thought, and may provide a mechanism for quantitative control of ATP production after brief or low frequency stimuli that raise [Ca(2+)](i) to levels below approximately 500 nM.},

	Abstract = {The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the key output cells of a complex neuronal network controlling fertility in mammals. To examine calcium homeostasis in postnatal GnRH neurons, we generated a transgenic mouse line in which the genetically encodable calcium indicator ratiometric Pericam (rPericam) was targeted to the GnRH neurons. This mouse model enabled real-time imaging of calcium concentrations in GnRH neurons in the acute brain slice preparation. Investigations in GnRH-rPericam mice revealed that GnRH neurons exhibited spontaneous, long-duration (~8s) calcium transients. Dual electrical-calcium recordings revealed that the calcium transients were correlated perfectly with burst firing in GnRH neurons and that calcium transients in GnRH neurons regulated two calcium-activated potassium channels that, in turn, determined burst firing dynamics in these cells. Curiously, the occurrence of calcium transients in GnRH neurons across puberty or through the estrous cycle did not correlate well with the assumption that GnRH neuron burst firing was contributory to changing patterns of pulsatile GnRH release at these times. The GnRH-rPericam mouse was also valuable in determining differential mechanisms of GABA and glutamate control of calcium levels in GnRH neurons as well as effects of G-protein-coupled receptors for GnRH and kisspeptin. The simultaneous measurement of calcium levels in multiple GnRH neurons was hampered by variable rPericam fluorescence in different GnRH neurons. Nevertheless, in the multiple recordings that were achieved no evidence was found for synchronous calcium transients. Together, these observations show the great utility of transgenic targeting strategies for investigating the roles of calcium with specified neuronal cell types.},

	Abstract = {The fire-diffuse-fire model provides an idealized model of Ca2+ release within living cells. The effect of calcium pumps, which drive Ca2+ back into internal stores, is often neglected for mathematical simplicity. Here we show how to explicitly analyse such effects by extending the work of Keizer et al. [Keizer, J. E., G. D. Smith, S. Ponce Dawson and J. Pearson (1998). Saltatory propagation of Ca2+ waves by Ca2+ sparks. Biophys. J. 75, 595-600.]. For travelling waves, in which release events occur sequentially, we construct the speed of waves in terms of the time-scale at which pumps operate. An immediate consequence of this analysis is that the inclusion of calcium pumps leads to multiple solutions. A linear stability analysis determines those solution branches in parameter space which are stable. Numerical continuation is used to provide explicit examples of the bifurcation diagrams of the speed of waves as a function of physiologically significant system parameters.},

Numerical simulations of the model illustrate that stochastic calcium release leads to the spontaneous production of calcium sparks that may merge to form saltatory waves. In the parameter regime where deterministic waves exist, it is possible to identify a critical level of noise, defining a nonequilibrium phase transition between propagating and abortive structures. A statistical analysis shows that this transition is the same as for models in the directed percolation universality class. Moreover, in the regime where no initial structure can survive deterministically, threshold noise is shown to generate a form of array enhanced coherence resonance, whereby all calcium stores release periodically and simultaneously.},

It is now well established that these waves are composed of elementary stochastic release events (calcium puffs or sparks) from spatially localised calcium stores. The aim of this paper is to analyse how the stochastic nature of individual receptors within these stores combines to create stochastic behaviour on long time-scales that may ultimately lead to waves of activity in a spatially extended cell model. Techniques from asymptotic analysis and stochastic phase-plane analysis are used to show that a large cluster of receptor channels leads to a release probability with a sigmoidal dependence on calcium density. This release probability is incorporated into a computationally inexpensive model of calcium release based upon a stochastic generalisation of the fire-diffuse-fire (FDF) threshold model. Numerical simulations of the model in one and two dimensions (with stores arranged on both regular and disordered lattices) illustrate that stochastic calcium release leads to the spontaneous production of calcium sparks that may merge to form saltatory waves. Illustrations of spreading circular waves, spirals and more irregular waves are presented. Furthermore, receptor noise is shown to generate a form of array enhanced coherence resonance whereby all calcium stores release periodically and simultaneously.},

Now it is reported that cultured hippocampal astrocytes can respond to glutamate with a prompt and oscillatory elevation of cytoplasmic free calcium, visible through use of the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo- 3. Two types of glutamate receptor--one preferring quisqualate and releasing calcium from intracellular stores and the other preferring kainate and promoting surface-membrane calcium influx--appear to be involved. Moreover, glutamate-induced increases in cytoplasmic free calcium frequently propagate as waves within the cytoplasm of individual astrocytes and between adjacent astrocytes in confluent cultures. These propagating waves of calcium suggest that networks of astrocytes may constitute a long-range signaling system within the brain.},

	Abstract = {We present an integrated thermokinetic model describing control of cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics. The model describes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling. The kinetic component of the model includes effectors of the TCA cycle enzymes regulating production of NADH and FADH(2), which in turn are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force (Delta mu(H)), driving the F(1)F(0)-ATPase. In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+), determined by Ca(2+) uniporter and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger activities, regulates activity of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The model is described by twelve ordinary differential equations for the time rate of change of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)), and matrix concentrations of Ca(2+), NADH, ADP, and TCA cycle intermediates. The model is used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange, and Ca(2+). The model is able to reproduce, qualitatively and semiquantitatively, experimental data concerning mitochondrial bioenergetics, Ca(2+) dynamics, and respiratory control. Significant increases in oxygen consumption (V(O(2))), proton efflux, NADH, and ATP synthesis, in response to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), are obtained when the Ca(2+)-sensitive dehydrogenases are the main rate-controlling steps of respiratory flux. These responses diminished when control is shifted downstream (e.g., the respiratory chain or adenine nucleotide translocator). The time-dependent behavior of the model, under conditions simulating an increase in workload, closely reproduces experimentally observed mitochondrial NADH dynamics in heart trabeculae subjected to changes in pacing frequency. The steady-state and time-dependent behavior of the model support the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) mediate ASMC contraction and proliferation, and thus play a key role in airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and remodelling in asthma. We evaluate the importance of store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) in these Ca(2+) dynamics by constructing a mathematical model of ASMC Ca(2+) signaling based on experimental data from lung slices. The model confirms that SOCE is elicited upon sufficient Ca(2+) depletion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), while receptor-operated [Ca(2+) entry (ROCE) is inhibited in such conditions. It also shows that SOCE can sustain agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in the absence of other [Ca(2+) influx. SOCE up-regulation may thus contribute to AHR by increasing the Ca(2+) oscillation frequency that in turn regulates ASMC contraction. The model also provides an explanation for the failure of the SERCA pump blocker CPA to clamp the cytosolic Ca(2+) of ASMC in lung slices, by showing that CPA is unable to maintain the SR empty of Ca(2+). This prediction is confirmed by experimental data from mouse lung slices, and strongly suggests that CPA only partially inhibits SERCA in ASMC.},

Recent data suggest that the Ca(2)+ signal transmission between RyR and mitochondria is dependent on local Ca(2)+ interactions between subdomains of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria.

	Abstract = {Evidence is emerging that a quasisynaptic local communication facilitates the calcium signaling between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. However, it remains elusive whether the machinery of mitochondrial calcium signaling displays plasticity similar to the synaptic transmission. Here we studied the relationship between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-linked cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) oscillations and the associated rise in mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]m) in RBL-2H3 mast cells. We observed that the second [Ca2+]c spike is often associated with a larger rise in the [Ca2+]m than the first. It would appear that this phenomenon was not due to a change in the driving force for Ca2+ uptake and therefore must be due to an enhanced Ca2+ permeability of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites (uniporter). To investigate the activation and deactivation kinetics of the uniporter during IP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, we established novel methods. Using these approaches, we demonstrated that the IP3-induced increase in the permeability of the uniporter lasted longer than the Ca2+ signal. The sustained increase in Ca2+ permeability was bidirectional. Furthermore, the addition of Ca2+ during the decay of the IP3 effect evoked a large further increase in the uniporter permeability. Calmodulin inhibitors did not interfere with the IP3-induced initial activation of the uniporter but inhibited the sustained phase. These results suggest that the uniporter displays a calmodulin-mediated facilitation. This plasticity may allow cooperation among sequential IP3 receptor-mediated [Ca2+] transients in the control of calcium signal propagation to the mitochondria.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondria form junctions with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER), which support signal transduction and biosynthetic pathways and affect organellar distribution. Recently, these junctions have received attention because of their pivotal role in mediating calcium signal propagation to the mitochondria, which is important for both ATP production and mitochondrial cell death. Many of the SR/ER-mitochondrial calcium transporters and signaling proteins are sensitive to redox regulation and are directly exposed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the mitochondria and SR/ER. Although ROS has been emerging as a novel signaling entity, the redox signaling of the SR/ER-mitochondrial interface is yet to be elucidated. We describe here possible mechanisms of the mutual interaction between local Ca(2+) and ROS signaling in the control of SR/ER-mitochondrial function.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake via the uniporter is central to cell metabolism, signaling, and survival. Recent studies identified MCU as the uniporter's likely pore and MICU1, an EF-hand protein, as its critical regulator. How this complex decodes dynamic cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)]c) signals, to tune out small [Ca(2+)]c increases yet permit pulse transmission, remains unknown. We report that loss of MICU1 in mouse liver and cultured cells causes mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation during small [Ca(2+)]c elevations but an attenuated response to agonist-induced [Ca(2+)]c pulses. The latter reflects loss of positive cooperativity, likely via the EF-hands. MICU1 faces the intermembrane space and responds to [Ca(2+)]c changes. Prolonged MICU1 loss leads to an adaptive increase in matrix Ca(2+) binding, yet cells show impaired oxidative metabolism and sensitization to Ca(2+) overload. Collectively, the data indicate that MICU1 senses the [Ca(2+)]c to establish the uniporter's threshold and gain, thereby allowing mitochondria to properly decode different inputs.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ liberation through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) plays a universal role in cell regulation, and specificity of cell signalling is achieved through the spatiotemporal patterning of Ca2+ signals. IP3Rs display Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), but are grouped in clusters so that regenerative Ca2+ signals may remain localized to individual clusters, or propagate globally between clusters by successive cycles of Ca2+ diffusion and CICR. We used confocal microscopy and photoreleased IP3 in Xenopus oocytes to study how these properties are modulated by mobile cytosolic Ca2+ buffers. EGTA (a buffer with slow 'on-rate') speeded Ca2+ signals and 'balkanized' Ca2+ waves by dissociating them into local signals. In contrast, BAPTA (a fast buffer with similar affinity) slowed Ca2+ responses and promoted 'globalization' of spatially uniform Ca2+ signals. These actions are likely to arise through differential effects on Ca2+ feedback within and between IP3R clusters, because Ca2+ signals evoked by influx through voltage-gated channels were little affected. We propose that cell-specific expression of Ca2+-binding proteins with distinct kinetics may shape the time course and spatial distribution of IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals for specific physiological roles.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+)-binding proteins (CaBPs) are expressed in a highly specific manner across many different cell types, yet the physiological basis underlying their selective distribution patterns remains unclear. We used confocal line-scan microscopy together with photo-release of IP(3) in Xenopus oocytes to investigate the actions of mobile cytosolic CaBPs on the spatiotemporal properties of IP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) signals. Parvalbumin (PV), a CaBP with slow Ca(2+)-binding kinetics, shortened the duration of IP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) signals and 'balkanized' global responses into discrete localized events (puffs). In contrast, calretinin (CR), a presumed fast buffer, prolonged Ca(2+) responses and promoted 'globalization' of spatially uniform Ca(2+) signals at high [IP(3)]. Oocytes loaded with CR or PV showed Ca(2+) puffs following photolysis flashes that were subthreshold in controls, and the spatiotemporal properties of these localized events were differentially modulated by PV and CR. In comparison to results we previously obtained with exogenous Ca(2+) buffers, PV closely mimicked the actions of the slow buffer EGTA, whereas CR showed important differences from the fast buffer BAPTA. Most notably, puffs were never observed after loading BAPTA, and this exogenous buffer did not show the marked sensitization of IP(3) action evident with CR. The ability of Ca(2+) buffers and CaBPs with differing kinetics to fine-tune both global and local intracellular Ca(2+) signals is likely to have significant physiological implications.},

	Abstract = {Calcium is a key ion and is known to mediate signalling pathways between cytosol and mitochondria and modulate mitochondrial energy metabolism. To gain a quantitative, biophysical understanding of mitochondrial Ca(2+) regulation, we developed a thermodynamically balanced model of mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling and bioenergetics by integrating kinetic models of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (CU), Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCE), and Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE) into an existing computational model of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Kinetic flux expressions for the CU, NCE and NHE were developed and individually parameterized based on independent data sets on flux rates measured in purified mitochondria. While available data support a wide range of possible values for the overall activity of the CU in cardiac and liver mitochondria, even at the highest estimated values, the Ca(2+) current through the CU does not have a significant effect on mitochondrial membrane potential. This integrated model was then used to analyse additional data on the dynamics and steady-states of mitochondrial Ca(2+) governed by mitochondrial CU and NCE. Our analysis of the data on the time course of matrix free [Ca(2+)] in respiring mitochondria purified from rabbit heart with addition of different levels of Na(+) to the external buffer medium (with the CU blocked) with two separate models--one with a 2:1 stoichiometry and the other with a 3:1 stoichiometry for the NCE--supports the hypothesis that the NCE is electrogenic with a stoichiometry of 3:1. This hypothesis was further tested by simulating an additional independent data set on the steady-state variations of matrix free [Ca(2+)] with respect to the variations in external free [Ca(2+)] in purified respiring mitochondria from rat heart to show that only the 3:1 stoichiometry model predictions are consistent with the data. Based on these analyses, it is concluded that the mitochondrial NCE is electrogenic with a stoichiometry of 3:1.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ transport through mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter is the primary Ca2+ uptake mechanism in respiring mitochondria. Thus, the uniporter plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial Ca2+. Despite the importance of mitochondrial Ca2+ to metabolic regulation and mitochondrial function, and to cell physiology and pathophysiology, the structure and composition of the uniporter functional unit and kinetic mechanisms associated with Ca2+ transport into mitochondria are still not well understood. In this study, based on available experimental data on the kinetics of Ca2+ transport via the uniporter, a mechanistic kinetic model of the uniporter is introduced. The model is thermodynamically balanced and satisfactorily describes a large number of independent data sets in the literature on initial or pseudo-steady-state influx rates of Ca2+ via the uniporter measured under a wide range of experimental conditions. The model is derived assuming a multi-state catalytic binding and Eyring's free-energy barrier theory-based transformation mechanisms associated with the carrier-mediated facilitated transport and electrodiffusion. The model is a great improvement over the previous theoretical models of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter in the literature in that it is thermodynamically balanced and matches a large number of independently published data sets on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. This theoretical model will be critical in developing mechanistic, integrated models of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and bioenergetics which can be helpful in understanding the mechanisms by which Ca2+ plays a role in mediating signaling pathways and modulating mitochondrial energy metabolism.},

Rapid superfusion of immobilized Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) in vitro showed that the enzyme can decode the frequency of Ca2+ spikes into distinct amounts of kinase activity. The frequency response of CaM kinase II was modulated by several factors, including the amplitude and duration of individual spikes as well as the subunit composition and previous state of activation of the kinase. These features should provide specificity in the activation of this multifunctional enzyme by distinct cellular stimuli and may underlie its pivotal role in activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity.},

	Abstract = {Many cells use calcium signaling to carry information from the extracellular side of the plasma membrane to targets in their interior. Since virtually all cells employ a network of biochemical reactions for Ca(2+) signaling, much effort has been devoted to understand the functional role of Ca(2+) responses and to decipher how their complex dynamics is regulated by the biochemical network of Ca(2+)-related signal transduction pathways. Experimental observations show that Ca(2+) signals in response to external stimuli encode information via frequency modulation (FM) or alternatively via amplitude modulation (AM). Although minimal models can capture separately both types of dynamics, they fail to exhibit different and more advanced encoding modes. By arguments of bifurcation theory, we propose instead that under some biophysical conditions more complex modes of information encoding can also be manifested by minimal models. We consider the minimal model of Li and Rinzel and show that information encoding can occur by AM of Ca(2+) oscillations, by FM or by both modes (AFM). Our work is motivated by calcium signaling in astrocytes, the predominant type of cortical glial cells that is nowadays recognized to play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal activity and information processing of the brain. We explain that our results can be crucial for a better understanding of synaptic information transfer. Furthermore, our results might also be important for better insight on other examples of physiological processes regulated by Ca(2+) signaling.},

	Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in neuron-glia communication. This interest stems from the realization that glia participate in cognitive functions and information processing and are involved in many brain disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. An important process in neuron-glia communications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer-the modulation of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) dynamics in astrocytes in response to synaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model for glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics that captures the essential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)). Starting from the well-known two-variable (intracellular Ca(2+) and inactive IP(3) receptors) Li-Rinzel model for calcium-induced calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of IP(3) production and phosphorylation. Doing so, we extend it to a three-variable model (which we refer to as the ChI model) that could account for Ca(2+) oscillations with endogenous IP(3) metabolism. This ChI model is then further extended into the G-ChI model to include regulation of IP(3) production by external glutamate signals. Compared with previous similar models, our three-variable models include a more realistic description of IP(3) production and degradation pathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise formulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate the existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between IP(3) and Ca(2+) pathways endow the system with self-consistent oscillatory properties and favor mixed frequency-amplitude encoding modes over pure amplitude-modulation ones. These and additional results of our model are in general agreement with available experimental data and may have important implications for the role of astrocytes in the synaptic transfer of information.},

Here we have identified in silico a protein (named MCU) that shares tissue distribution with MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), a recently characterized uniporter regulator, is present in organisms in which mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake was demonstrated and whose sequence includes two transmembrane domains. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of MCU in HeLa cells markedly reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. MCU overexpression doubled the matrix Ca(2+) concentration increase evoked by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists, thus significantly buffering the cytosolic elevation. The purified MCU protein showed channel activity in planar lipid bilayers, with electrophysiological properties and inhibitor sensitivity of the uniporter. A mutant MCU, in which two negatively charged residues of the putative pore-forming region were replaced, had no channel activity and reduced agonist-dependent matrix Ca(2+) concentration transients when overexpressed in HeLa cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that the 40-kDa protein identified is the channel responsible for ruthenium-red-sensitive mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, thus providing a molecular basis for this process of utmost physiological and pathological relevance.},

	Abstract = {Hodgkin and Huxley provided the first quantitative description of voltage-dependent currents and adjusted their model to experimental data using empirical functions of voltage. A physically plausible formalism was proposed later by assuming that transition rates depend exponentially on a free-energy barrier, by analogy with the theory of reaction rates. It was also assumed that the free energy depends linearly on voltage. This thermodynamic formalism can accurately describe many processes, but the resulting time constants can be arbitrarily fast, which may also lead to aberrant behavior. We considered here a physically plausible solution to this problem by including nonlinear effects of the electrical field on the free energy. We show that including effects such as mechanical constraints, inherent to the structure of the ion channel protein, leads to more accurate thermodynamic models. These models can account for voltage-dependent transitions that are rate-limited in a given voltage range, without invoking additional states. We illustrate their applicability to fit experimental data by considering the case of the T-type calcium current in thalamic neurons.},

	Abstract = {Puffs are local Ca(2+) signals that arise by Ca(2+) liberation from the endoplasmic reticulum through concerted opening of tightly clustered inositol trisphosphate receptor/channels (IP(3)R). They serve both local signaling functions and trigger global Ca(2+) waves. The numbers of functional IP(3)R within clusters differ appreciably between different puff sites, and we investigated how the probability of puff occurrence varies with cluster size. We imaged puffs in SH-SY5Y cells using total internal fluorescence microscopy, and estimated cluster sizes from the magnitude of the largest puff observed at each site relative to the signal from a single channel. We find that the initial triggering rate of puffs following photorelease of IP(3), and the average frequency of subsequent repetitive puffs, vary about linearly with cluster size. These data accord well with stochastic simulations in which opening of any individual IP(3)R channel within a cluster triggers a puff via Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. An important consequence is that the signaling power of a puff site (average amount of Ca(2+) released per puff × puff frequency) varies about the square of cluster size, implying that large clusters contribute disproportionately to cellular signaling and, because of their higher puff frequency, preferentially act as pacemakers to initiate Ca(2+) waves.},

	Abstract = {Detailed experimental data from patch clamp experiments on pancreatic alpha-cells in intact mouse islets are used to model the electrical activity associated with glucagon secretion. Our model incorporates L- and T-type Ca(2+) currents, delayed rectifying and A-type K(+) currents, a voltage-gated Na(+) current, a KATP conductance, and an unspecific leak current. Tolbutamide closes KATP channels in the alpha-cell, leading to a reduction of the resting conductance from 1.1 nS to 0.4 nS. This causes the alpha-cell to depolarise from -76 mV to 33 mV. When the basal membrane potential passes the range between -60 and -35 mV, the alpha-cell generates action potentials. At higher voltages, the alpha-cell enters a stable depolarised state and the electrical activity ceases. The effects of tolbutamide are simulated by gradually reducing the KATP conductance (g(K,ATP)) from 500 pS to 0 pS. When g(K,ATP ) is between 72 nS and 303 nS, the model generates action potentials in the same voltage range as the alpha-cell. When g(K,ATP) is lower than 72 nS, the model enters a stable depolarised state, and firing of action potentials is inhibited due to voltage-dependent inactivation of the Na(+) and T-type Ca(2+) currents. This is in accordance with experimental results. Changing the inactivation parameters to those observed in somatostatin-secreting delta-cells abolishes the depolarised inactive state, and leads to beta-cell like electrical activity with action potentials generated even after complete closure of the KATP channels.},

	Abstract = {Cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) oscillations are a nearly universal mode of signalling in excitable and non-excitable cells. Although Ca2+ is known to mediate a diverse array of cell functions, it is not known whether oscillations contribute to the efficiency or specificity of signalling or are merely an inevitable consequence of the feedback control of [Ca2+]i. We have developed a Ca2+ clamp technique to investigate the roles of oscillation amplitude and frequency in regulating gene expression driven by the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-AT, Oct/OAP and NF-kappaB. Here we report that oscillations reduce the effective Ca2+ threshold for activating transcription factors, thereby increasing signal detection at low levels of stimulation. In addition, specificity is encoded by the oscillation frequency: rapid oscillations stimulate all three transcription factors, whereas infrequent oscillations activate only NF-kappaB. The genes encoding the cytokines interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 are also frequency-sensitive in a way that reflects their degree of dependence on NF-AT versus NF-kappaB. Our results provide direct evidence that [Ca2+]i oscillations increase both the efficacy and the information content of Ca2+ signals that lead to gene expression and cell differentiation.},

	Abstract = {GnRH neurons are hypothalamic neurons that secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) which stimulates the release of gonadotropins, one of the crucial hormones for sexual development, fertility and maturation. A mathematical model was built to help elucidate the mechanisms underlying electrical bursting and synchronous [Ca²(+)] transients in GnRH neurons (Lee et al., 2010). The model predicted that bursting in GnRH neurons (at least of the short-bursting type) requires the existence of a [Ca²(+)]-dependent slow after-hyperpolarisation current (sI(AHP-UCL)), and this predicted current was found experimentally. GnRH behaviour under a wide range of conditions (inhibition of Na(+) channels, IP₃ receptors, [Ca²(+)]-dependent K(+) channels, or Ca²(+) pumps, or in the presence of zero extracellular [Ca²(+)]) is successfully reproduced by the model. In this paper, a simplified version of the previous model, with the same qualitative behaviour, is constructed and studied using timescale separation techniques and bifurcation analysis.},

	Abstract = {Many studies of Ca2+ signaling use PC12 cells, yet the balance of Ca2+ clearance mechanisms in these cells is unknown. We used pharmacological inhibition of Ca2+ transporters to characterize Ca2+ clearance after depolarizations in both undifferentiated and nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells. Sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) account for almost all Ca2+ clearance in both cell states, with NCX and PMCA making the greatest contributions. Any contribution of mitochondrial uniporters is small. The ATP pool in differentiated cells was much more labile than that of undifferentiated cells in the presence of agents that dissipated mitochondrial proton gradients. Differentiated PC12 cells have a small component of Ca2+ clearance possessing pharmacological characteristics consistent with secretory pathway Ca2+ ATPase (SPCA), potentially residing on Golgi and/or secretory granules. Undifferentiated and differentiated cells are similar in overall Ca2+ transport and in the small transport due to SERCA, but they differ in the fraction of transport by PMCA and NCX. Transport in neurites of differentiated PC12 cells was qualitatively similar to that in the somata, except that the ER stores in neurites sometimes released Ca2+ instead of clearing it after depolarization. We formulated a mathematical model to simulate the observed Ca2+ clearance and to describe the differences between these undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated states quantitatively. The model required a value for the endogenous Ca2+ binding ratio of PC12 cell cytoplasm, which we measured to be 268 +/- 85. Our results indicate that Ca2+ transport in undifferentiated PC12 cells is quite unlike transport in adrenal chromaffin cells, for which they often are considered models. Transport in both cell states more closely resembles that of sympathetic neurons, for which differentiated PC12 cells often are considered models. Comparison with other cell types shows that different cells emphasize different Ca2+ transport mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Quantal release, incremental detection, and oscillations are three types of Ca2+ responses that can be obtained in different conditions, after stimulation of the intracellular Ca2+ stores by submaximum concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3). All three phenomena are thought to occur through the regulatory properties of the InsP3 receptor/Ca2+ channel. In the present study, we perform further analysis of the model (Swillens et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 91:10074-10078) previously proposed for transient InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, based on the bell-shaped dependence of the InsP3 receptor activity on the Ca2+ level and on the existence of an intermediate Ca2+ domain located around the mouth of the channel. We show that Ca2+ oscillations also arise in the latter model. Conditions for the occurrence of the various behaviors are investigated. Numerical simulations also show that the existence of an intermediate Ca2+ domain can markedly increase the period of oscillations. Periods on the order of 1 min can indeed be accounted for by the model when one assigns realistic values to the kinetic constants of the InsP3 receptor, which, in the absence of a domain, lead to oscillations with periods of a few seconds. Finally, theoretical support in favor of a positive cooperativity in the regulation of the InsP3 receptor by Ca2+ is presented.},

	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) is responsible for Ca2+ mobilization in response to external stimulation in many cell types. The latter phenomenon often occurs as repetitive Ca2+ spikes. In this study, the effect of the two Ins-1,4,5-P3 metabolizing enzymes (Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase and 5-phosphatase) on the temporal pattern of Ca2+ oscillations has been investigated. On the basis of the well-documented Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase stimulation by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex and of the experimentally-determined kinetic characteristics of these enzymes, we predict that 5-phosphatase primarily controls the levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 and, thereby, the occurrence and frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. Consequently, the model reproduces the experimental observation performed in Chinese hamster ovary cells that 5-phosphatase overexpression has a much more pronounced effect on the pattern of Ca2+ oscillations than 3-kinase overexpression. We also investigated, in more detail, under which conditions a similar effect could be observed in other cell types expressing various Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase activities.},

	Abstract = {Intercellular calcium signals are propagated in multicellular hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The stimulation of connected hepatocytes by glycogenolytic agonists induces reproducible sequences of intracellular calcium concentration increases, resulting in unidirectional intercellular calcium waves. Hepatocytes are characterized by a gradient of vasopressin binding sites from the periportal to perivenous areas of the cell plate in hepatic lobules. Also, coordination of calcium signals between neighboring cells requires the presence of the agonist at each cell surface as well as gap junction permeability. We present a model based on the junctional coupling of several hepatocytes differing in sensitivity to the agonist and thus in the intrinsic period of calcium oscillations. In this model, each hepatocyte displays repetitive calcium spikes with a slight phase shift with respect to neighboring cells, giving rise to a phase wave. The orientation of the apparent calcium wave is imposed by the direction of the gradient of hormonal sensitivity. Calcium spikes are coordinated by the diffusion across junctions of small amounts of inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)). Theoretical predictions from this model are confirmed experimentally. Thus, major physiological insights may be gained from this model for coordination and spatial orientation of intercellular signals.-Dupont, G., Tordjmann, T., Clair, C., Swillens, S., Claret, M., Combettes, L.

	Abstract = {Receptor-mediated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) initiates Ca(2+) release and is responsible for cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations. InsP(3) oscillations have also been observed in some cells. One of the enzymes controlling InsP(3) catabolism, the InsP(3) 3-kinase, is stimulated by Ca(2+); this regulation is presumably part of the reason for InsP(3) oscillations that have been observed in some cells. Here, we investigate the possible role of Ca(2+)-activated InsP(3) catabolism on the characteristics of the InsP(3)-induced Ca(2+) oscillations. Numerical simulations show that if it is assumed that the Ca(2+)-independent InsP(3) catabolism is predominant, Ca(2+) oscillations remain qualitatively unchanged although the relative amplitude of the oscillations in InsP(3) concentrations becomes minimal. We tested this prediction in hepatocytes by masking the Ca(2+)-dependent InsP(3) catabolism by 3-kinase through the injection of massive amounts of InsP(3) 5-phosphatase, which is not stimulated by Ca(2+). We find that in such injected hepatocytes, Ca(2+) oscillations generated by modest agonist levels are suppressed, presumably because of the decreased dose in InsP(3), but that at higher doses of agonist, oscillations reappear, with characteristics similar to those of untreated cells at low agonist doses. Altogether, these results suggest that oscillations in InsP(3) concentration due to Ca(2+)-stimulated InsP(3) catabolism do not play a major role for the oscillations in Ca(2+) concentration.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ are well-known to rely on the regulatory properties of the InsP3R (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor). Three isoforms of this channel have been identified. They differ in their regulatory properties by Ca2+ and InsP3. Experiments in different cell types clearly indicate that the relative amounts of each isoform affect the time course of Ca2+ changes after agonist stimulation. In the present study, we investigate whether different steady-state curves for the open probability of the InsP3Rs as a function of Ca2+ imply different dynamical behaviours when these receptors are present in a cellular environment. We therefore describe by a specific phenomenological model the three main types of curves that have been reported: (i) the classical bell-shaped curve, (ii) the bell-shaped curve that is shifted towards higher Ca2+ concentrations when InsP3 is increased, and (iii) a monotonous increasing function of cytosolic Ca2+.
RESULTS: We show that, although these types of curves can be ascribed to slight differences in the channel regulation by Ca2+ and InsP3, they can indicate important variations as to the receptor role in cellular Ca2+ control. Thus the receptor associated with the classical bell-shaped curve appears to be the most robust Ca2+ oscillator. If the steady-state curve is supposed to be a monotonous increasing function of cytosolic Ca2+, the modelled receptor cannot sustain Ca2+ oscillations in the absence of Ca2+ exchanges with the extracellular medium. When the bell-shaped curve is shifted towards higher Ca2+ concentrations with increasing InsP3 levels, the model predicts that the receptor is less robust to changes in density; this receptor, however, provides a finer control of the steady-state level of Ca2+ when varying the InsP3 concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model allows us to propose an explanation for the experimental observations about the effect of selectively expressing or down-regulating InsP3R isoforms, as well as to make theoretical predictions.},

	Abstract = {Many essential physiological processes are controlled by calcium. To ensure reliability and specificity, calcium signals are highly organized in time and space in the form of oscillations and waves. Interesting findings have been obtained at various scales, ranging from the stochastic opening of a single calcium channel to the intercellular calcium wave spreading through an entire organ. A detailed understanding of calcium dynamics thus requires a link between observations at different scales. It appears that some regulations such as calcium-induced calcium release or PLC activation by calcium, as well as the weak diffusibility of calcium ions play a role at all levels of organization in most cell types. To comprehend how calcium waves spread from one cell to another, specific gap-junctional coupling and paracrine signaling must also be taken into account. On the basis of a pluridisciplinar approach ranging from physics to physiology, a unified description of calcium dynamics is emerging, which could help understanding how such a small ion can mediate so many vital functions in living systems.},

	Abstract = {Signal-induced Ca(2+) oscillations have been observed in many cell types and play a primary role in cell physiology. Although it is the regular character of these oscillations that first catches the attention, a closer look at time series of Ca(2+) increases reveals that the fluctuations on the period during individual spike trains are far from negligible. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of the regularity of Ca(2+) oscillations in norepinephrine-stimulated hepatocytes and find that the coefficient of variation lies between 10% and 15%. Stochastic simulations based on Gillespie's algorithm and considering realistic numbers of Ca(2+) ions and inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptors account for this variability if the receptors are assumed to be grouped in clusters of a few tens of channels. Given the relatively small number of clusters ( approximately 200), the model predicts the existence of repetitive spikes induced by fluctuations (stochastic resonance). Oscillations of this type are found in hepatocytes at subthreshold concentrations of norepinephrine. We next predict with the model that the isoforms of the InsP(3) receptor can affect the variability of the oscillations. In contrast, possible accompanying InsP(3) oscillations have no impact on the robustness of signal-induced repetitive Ca(2+) spikes.},

	Abstract = {In most cells, Ca(2+) increases in response to external stimulation are organized in the form of oscillations and waves that sometimes propagate from one cell to another. Numerous experimental and theoretical studies reveal that this spatiotemporal organization contains a non-negligible level of stochasticity. In this study, we extend the previous work based on a statistical analysis of experimental Ca(2+) traces in isolated, hormone-stimulated hepatocytes and on stochastic simulations of Ca(2+) oscillations based on the Gillespie's algorithm. Comparison of the coefficients of variation in the periods of experimental and simulated Ca(2+) spikes provides information about the clustering and the specific subtypes of the Ca(2+) channels. In hepatocytes coupled by gap junctions, the global perfusion with a hormone leads to successive Ca(2+) responses, giving the appearance of an intercellular wave. Statistical analysis of experimental Ca(2+) oscillations in coupled hepatocytes confirms that this coordinated Ca(2+) spiking corresponds to a phase wave but suggests the existence of an additional coupling mechanism.},

This complexity is obvious from the pattern of calcium signals observed with modest, physiological concentrations of calcium-mobilizing agonists, which typically present as sequential regenerative discharges of stored calcium, a process referred to as calcium oscillations. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the underlying mechanism of calcium oscillations through the power of mathematical modeling. We also summarize recent findings on the role of calcium entry through store-operated channels in sustaining calcium oscillations and in the mechanism by which calcium oscillations couple to downstream effectors.},

It has recently been observed that stimulating dendrites locally with a single glutamate/glycine puff induces a local translocation of CaMKII into spines that subsequently spreads in a wave-like manner towards the distal dendritic arbor. Here we present a mathematical model of the diffusion, activation and translocation of dendritic CaMKII. We show how the nonlinear dynamics of CaMKII diffusion-activation generates a propagating translocation wave, provided that the rate of activation is sufficiently fast. We also derive an explicit formula for the wave speed as a function of physiological parameters such as the diffusivity of CaMKII and the density of spines. Our model provides a quantitative framework for understanding the spread of CaMKII translocation and its possible role in heterosynaptic plasticity.},

	Abstract = {Networks of glial cells, and in particular astrocytes, are capable of sustaining calcium (Ca(2+)) waves both in vivo and in vitro. Experimentally, it has been shown that there are two separate modes of communication: the first by the passage of an agent (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, IP(3)) through gap junctions (GJs) joining cells; the second by the diffusion of an extracellular agent (adenosine triphosphate, ATP) that binds to receptors on the cells. In both cases, the outcome is the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores in the glial cells. These two modes of communication are not mutually exclusive, but probably work in conjunction in many cases. We present a model of a two-dimensional network of glial cells that incorporates regenerative intercellular (GJ) and extracellular (ATP) pathways. In the extreme cases of only one type of pathway, the results are in agreement with previous models. Adding an extracellular pathway to the GJ model increased the extent and duration of the Ca(2+) wave, but did not significantly change the speed of propagation. Conversely, adding GJs to the extracellular model did increase the wave speed. The model was modified to apply to the retina by extending it to include both astrocytes and M{\"u}ller cells, with GJs the dominant coupling between astrocytes and ATP responsible for most of the remaining communication. It was found that both pathways are necessary to account for experimental results.},

Recent functional analysis indicates that in some fast central synapses, transmitter release is triggered by a small number of Ca(2+) channels that are coupled to Ca(2+) sensors at the nanometre scale. Molecular analysis suggests that this tight coupling is generated by protein-protein interactions involving Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) sensors and various other synaptic proteins.

	Abstract = {Calcium sparks represent local, rapid, and transient calcium release events from a cluster of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), calcium sparks activate calcium-dependent potassium channels causing decrease in the global intracellular [Ca2+] and oppose vasoconstriction. This is in contrast to cardiac and skeletal muscle, where spatial and temporal summation of calcium sparks leads to global increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and myocyte contraction. We summarize the present data on local RyR calcium signaling in arterial SMCs in comparison to striated muscle and muscle-specific differences in coupling between L-type calcium channels and RyRs. Accordingly, arterial SMC Ca(v)1.2 L-type channels regulate intracellular calcium stores content, which in turn modulates calcium efflux though RyRs. Downregulation of RyR2 up to a certain degree is compensated by increased SR calcium content to normalize calcium sparks. This indirect coupling between Ca(v)1.2 and RyR in arterial SMCs is opposite to striated muscle, where triggering of calcium sparks is controlled by rapid and direct cross-talk between Ca(v)1.1/Ca(v)1.2 L-type channels and RyRs. We discuss the role of RyR isoforms in initiation and formation of calcium sparks in SMCs and their possible molecular binding partners and regulators, which differ compared to striated muscle.},

This molecule can function as a second messenger, but its roles are not completely understood. The A isoform of inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate 3-kinase localises to filamentous actin within dendritic spines in the hippocampus and is implicated in the regulation of spine morphology and long term potentiation, however the mechanisms through which it signals in neuronal cells are not completely understood. We have used NGF driven neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells as a platform to examine the impact of signaling via inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate 3-kinase activity in a neuronal cell. We have found that the catalytic activity of the enzyme opposes neurite outgrowth, whilst pharmacological inhibition of inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate 3-kinase leads to a significant increase in neurite outgrowth, and we show that the reduction in neurite outgrowth in response to inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate 3-kinase activity correlates with reduced ERK activity as determined by western blotting using phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Our findings suggest a novel neuronal signaling pathway linking metabolism of IP(3) to signaling via ERK.},

	Abstract = {1. Fragments of single cardiac cells were obtained by homogenization of ventricular tissue from adult rats. Remaining pieces of sacrolemma were removed by micro-dissection. Tension was recorded from the ends of the skinned (sarcolemma-free) cells with a photodiode force transducer. 2. In the presence of a strong buffering of the free [Ca2+] with 4-0 mM total EGTA, a tonic tension was obtained that increased according to t sigmoid curve when the free ([Ca2+] was increased from 10(-6-75)M to 10(-5-0)M. This curve was not modified by the destruction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by the detergent Brij 58. Therefore, the tonic tension corresponded to the direct effect of the free [Ca2+] present in the buffer on the myofilaments. 3. In the presence of a slight buffering of the free [Ca2+] with 0-050 mM total EGTA, cyclic contractions were observed that were attributed to cyclic releases and re-sequestrations of Ca2+ by the SR. The absence of effect of azide and ruthenium red on the cyclic contractions obtained at a free [Ca2+] lower than 10(-6-50)M demonstrated that the mitochondria played no role in the triggering of these contractions. 4. Cyclic contractions were induced by a slight variation of free [Ca2+] in the buffer from 10(-7-65)M to 10(-7-40)M. Their amplitude at 10(-7-40)M free Ca2+ was equal to the tonic tension developed by a free [Ca2+] 20 times higher applied to the myofilaments when the SR was destroyed by detergent or functionally inhibited by high total [EGTA]. It was concluded that these cyclic contractions corresponded to a Ca2+-triggered release of Ca2+ from the SR. 5. The cyclic contractions were induced by the filling of the SR with Ca2+ to a critical level at which it released a fraction of the Ca2+ it contained. Each contraction was followed by a re-sequestration of Ca2+, the kinetics of which conditioned the duration of the cycles. 6. The amplitude of the cyclic contractions increased when the free [Ca2+] that triggered them was increased. This gradation was deemed incompatible with a simple regenerative process, which should produce an all-or-nothing response. Additional process, such as a modulation of the Ca2+ release by free [Mg2+] and [ADP] may help to explain the gradation of the contractions. 7. It was concluded that a Ca2+-triggered release of Ca2+ from the SR of rat ventricular cells may amplify the Ca2+ flux crossing the sarcolemma during the plateau of the action potential, thereby permitting the activation of the myofilaments.},

The number of pulsatile foci is reduced and spiral Ca2+ waves are no longer observed. Rather, target patterns of Ca2+ release predominate, and when fragmented, fail to form spirals. Ca2+ wave velocity, amplitude, decay time, and periodicity are also increased. We have simulated these experimental findings by supplementing an existing mathematical model with a differential equation for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release. Our calculations show that mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux plays a critical role in pattern formation by prolonging the recovery time of IP3Rs from a refractory state. We also show that under conditions of high energization of mitochondria, the Ca2+ dynamics can become bistable with a second stable stationary state of high resting Ca2+ concentration.},

The channel subunit dynamics is a stochastic representation of the DeYoung-Keizer model. The calculations show that the concentration profile of fast buffer around an open channel is more localized than that of slow buffers. Slow buffers allow for release of larger amounts of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum and hence bind more Ca(2+) than fast buffers with the same dissociation constant and concentration. I find oscillation-like behavior for high slow buffer concentration and low Ca(2+) content of the endoplasmic reticulum. High concentration of slow buffer leads to oscillation-like behavior by repetitive wave nucleation for high Ca(2+) content of the endoplasmic reticulum. Localization of Ca(2+) release by slow buffer, as used in experiments, can be reproduced by the modeling approach.},

	Abstract = {Gq protein-coupled receptors (GqPCRs) of the plasma membrane activate the phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascade. PLC cleaves the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into the second messengers diacylgycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), leading to calcium release, protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and in some cases, PIP2 depletion. We determine the kinetics of each of these downstream endpoints and also ask which is responsible for the inhibition of KCNQ2/3 (KV7.2/7.3) potassium channels in single living tsA-201 cells. We measure DAG production and PKC activity by F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer-based sensors, and PIP2 by KCNQ2/3 channels. Fully activating endogenous purinergic receptors by uridine 5&apos;triphosphate (UTP) leads to calcium release, DAG production, and PKC activation, but no net PIP2 depletion. Fully activating high-density transfected muscarinic receptors (M1Rs) by oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) leads to similar calcium, DAG, and PKC signals, but PIP2 is depleted. KCNQ2/3 channels are inhibited by the Oxo-M treatment (85%) and not by UTP (&lt;1%), indicating that depletion of PIP2 is required to inhibit KCNQ2/3 in response to receptor activation. Overexpression of A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP)79 or calmodulin (CaM) does not increase KCNQ2/3 inhibition by UTP. From these results and measurements of IP3 and calcium presented in our companion paper (Dickson et al. 2013. J. Gen. Physiol. http://dx.doi.org/10.1085/jgp.201210886), we extend our kinetic model for signaling from M1Rs to DAG/PKC and IP3/calcium signaling. We conclude that calcium/CaM and PKC-mediated phosphorylation do not underlie dynamic KCNQ2/3 channel inhibition during GqPCR activation in tsA-201 cells. Finally, our experimental data provide indirect evidence for cleavage of PI(4)P by PLC in living cells, and our modeling revisits/explains the concept of receptor reserve with measurements from all steps of GqPCR signaling.},

	Abstract = {The fertilization Ca2+ wave in Xenopus laevis is a single, large wave of elevated free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that emanates from the point of sperm-egg fusion and traverses the entire diameter of the egg. This phenomenon appears to involve an increase in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) resulting from interaction of the sperm and egg, which then results in the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release machinery. We have proposed models based on a static elevated distribution of IP3, and dynamic [IP3], however, these models have suggested that the fertilization wave passes through the center of the egg. Complementing these earlier models, we propose a more detailed model of the fertilization Ca2+ wave in Xenopus eggs to explore the hypothesis that IP3 is produced only at or near the plasma membrane. In this case, we find that the wave propagates primarily through the cortex of the egg, and that Ca2+ -induced production of IP3 at the plasma membrane allows IP3 to propagate in advance of the wave. Our model includes Ca2+ -dependent production of IP3 at the plasma membrane and IP3 degradation. Simulations in 1 dimension and axi-symmetric 3 dimensions illustrate the basic features of the wave.},

In this review, we focus on how ultrasensitive components can be important for the functioning of more complex signaling circuits. Ultrasensitivity can allow the effective transmission of signals down a signaling cascade, can contribute to the generation of bistability by positive feedback, and can promote the production of biochemical oscillations in negative feedback loops. This makes ultrasensitivity a key building block in systems biology and synthetic biology.},

	Abstract = {The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a family of Ca2+ release channels found on intracellular Ca2+ storage/release organelles. The RyR channels are ubiquitously expressed in many types of cells and participate in a variety of important Ca2+ signaling phenomena (neurotransmission, secretion, etc.). In striated muscle, the RyR channels represent the primary pathway for Ca2+ release during the excitation-contraction coupling process. In general, the signals that activate the RyR channels are known (e.g., sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx or depolarization), but the specific mechanisms involved are still being debated. The signals that modulate and/or turn off the RyR channels remain ambiguous and the mechanisms involved unclear. Over the last decade, studies of RyR-mediated Ca2+ release have taken many forms and have steadily advanced our knowledge. This robust field, however, is not without controversial ideas and contradictory results. Controversies surrounding the complex Ca2+ regulation of single RyR channels receive particular attention here. In addition, a large body of information is synthesized into a focused perspective of single RyR channel function. The present status of the single RyR channel field and its likely future directions are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced calcium release from intracellular stores is a regulator of cytosolic-free calcium levels. The subsecond kinetics and regulation of IP3-induced calcium-45 release from synaptosome-derived microsomal vesicles were resolved by rapid superfusion. Extravesicular calcium acted as a coagonist, potentiating the transient IP3-induced release of calcium-45. Thus, rapid elevation of cytosolic calcium levels may trigger IP3-induced calcium release in vivo. Extravesicular calcium also produced a more slowly developing, reversible inhibition of IP3-induced calcium-45 release. Sequential positive and negative feedback regulation by calcium of IP3-induced calcium release may contribute to transients and oscillations of cytosolic-free calcium in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The plasma membrane electrical activities of neurons that secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) have been studied extensively. A couple of mathematical models have been developed previously to explain different aspects of these activities. The goal of this article is to develop a single model that accounts for the previously modeled experimental results and some more recent results that have not been accounted for. The latter includes two types of membrane potential bursting mechanisms and their associated cytosolic calcium oscillations. One bursting mechanism has not been reported in experiments and is thus regarded as a model prediction. Although the model is mainly based on data collected in immortalized GnRH cell lines, it is capable of explaining some properties of GnRH neurons observed in several other preparations including mature GnRH neurons in hypothalamic slices. We present a spatial model that incorporates a detailed description of calcium dynamics in a three-dimensional cell body with the ion channels evenly distributed on the cell surface. A phenomenological reduction of the spatial model into a simplified form is also presented. The simplified model will facilitate the study of the roles of plasma membrane electrical activities in the pulsatile release of GnRH.},

	Abstract = {In secretory epithelial cells, complex patterns of Ca2+ signals regulate physiological processes. How these patterns are generated is still not fully understood. In particular, the basis of global Ca2+ waves is not clear. We have studied regional differences in InsP3-evoked Ca2+ release in single mouse pancreatic acinar cells, using high-speed (approximately 90 frames s-1), high-sensitivity Ca2+ imaging combined with rapid (10 ms) spot photolysis (2 micrometer diameter) of caged InsP3. Within a single region we measured Ca2+ response latency and rate of rise to construct an InsP3 dose-response relationship. Spot InsP3 liberation in the secretory pole region consistently elicited a dose-dependent, rapid release of Ca2+. Spot InsP3 liberation in the basal pole region of approximately 50% of cells elicited a similar dose-response relationship but with a lower apparent InsP3 affinity than in the secretory pole. In the other cells, basal pole InsP3 liberation did not elicit active Ca2+ release, even at the highest stimulus intensities we employed, although these same cells did respond when the stimulus spot was moved to different regions. We conclude that in the basal pole active sites of rapid Ca2+ release have a lower functional affinity for InsP3 than those in the secretory pole and are spread out in discrete sites across the basal pole. These properties explain the propagation of Ca2+ waves across the basal pole that are only observed at higher stimulus levels.},

	Abstract = {We have used confocal microscopy to examine the [Ca2+]i increase in the albino eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis after fertilization. Eggs were placed in agar wells with their animal poles downward so that fertilization occurred preferentially in the equatorial plane, and confocal microscopy was used to provide a two-dimensional optical section through the three-dimensional Ca2+ wave. These data indicate that the wave of increased [Ca2+]i traverses the entire egg and converges uniformly on the antipode. We show that ratioing two different fluorescent dyes to correct for variations in cell thickness is not a reliable technique for this very thick cell due to differential absorption with depth. Indo-1-dextran proves to be a more reliable Ca2+ indicator in this respect. Indo-1-dextran measurements indicate that the resting [Ca2+]i is not uniform throughout the egg but exhibits a 15% higher [Ca2+]i in the cortex than deep in the cytoplasm. This difference is accentuated during wave propagation and is not dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The average peak [Ca2+]i in the center of the egg as the wave propagates through it is 0.7 microM, approximately 60% of the peak cortical [Ca2+]i. The wave velocity through the center of the egg (5.7 micron/s) is slower than that in the cortex (8.9 micron/s), and both velocities vary slightly during transit. The cortical wave speed is particularly high at the beginning (15.7 micron/s) and end (17.2 micron/s) of the wave. Eggs injected with 30-80 microM of 3 kD heparin to compete with inositol-1,4,5,-trisphosphate for binding to its receptor exhibited multiple localized spots of elevated [Ca2+]i, and many of these did not initiate a wave. For those that did lead to a wave, it was usually slow moving and exhibited a reduced (60% reduction) amplitude compared with controls.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution differential interference contrast microscopy and digital imaging of the fluorescent calcium indicator dye fura-2 were performed simultaneously in single rat salivary gland acinar cells to examine the effects of muscarinic stimulation on cell volume and cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Agonist stimulation of fluid secretion is initially associated with a rapid tenfold increase in [Ca2+]i as well as a substantial cell shrinkage. Subsequent changes of cell volume in the continued presence of agonist are tightly coupled to dynamic levels of [Ca2+]i, even during [Ca2+]i oscillations. Experiments with Ca2+ chelators and ionophores showed that physiological elevations of [Ca2+]i are necessary and sufficient to cause changes in cell volume. The relation between [Ca2+]i and cell volume suggests that the latter reflects the secretory state of the acinar cell. Agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i, by modulating specific ion permeabilities, result in solute movement into or out of the cell. The resultant cell volume changes may be important in modulating salivary secretion.},

	Abstract = {The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors (InsP3Rs) are a family of Ca2+ release channels localized predominately in the endoplasmic reticulum of all cell types. They function to release Ca2+ into the cytoplasm in response to InsP3 produced by diverse stimuli, generating complex local and global Ca2+ signals that regulate numerous cell physiological processes ranging from gene transcription to secretion to learning and memory. The InsP3R is a calcium-selective cation channel whose gating is regulated not only by InsP3, but by other ligands as well, in particular cytoplasmic Ca2+. Over the last decade, detailed quantitative studies of InsP3R channel function and its regulation by ligands and interacting proteins have provided new insights into a remarkable richness of channel regulation and of the structural aspects that underlie signal transduction and permeation. Here, we focus on these developments and review and synthesize the literature regarding the structure and single-channel properties of the InsP3R.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a detailed mathematical model of ionic flux in beta-cells that includes the most essential channels and pumps in the plasma membrane. This model is coupled to equations describing Ca2+, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), ATP, and Na+ homeostasis, including the uptake and release of Ca2+ by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In our model, metabolically derived ATP activates inward Ca2+ flux by regulation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and depolarization of the plasma membrane. Results from the simulations support the hypothesis that intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ in the ER can be the main variables driving both fast (2-7 osc/min) and slow intracellular Ca2+ concentration oscillations (0.3-0.9 osc/min) and that the effect of IP3 on Ca2+ leak from the ER contributes to the pattern of slow calcium oscillations. Simulations also show that filling the ER Ca2+ stores leads to faster electrical bursting and Ca2+ oscillations. Specific Ca2+ oscillations in isolated beta-cell lines can also be simulated.},

	Abstract = {We examined the ionic mechanisms mediating depolarization-induced spike activity in pancreatic beta-cells. We formulated a Hodgkin-Huxley-type ionic model for the action potential (AP) in these cells based on voltage- and current-clamp results together with measurements of Ca(2+) dynamics in wild-type and Kv2.1 null mouse islets. The model contains an L-type Ca(2+) current, a "rapid" delayed-rectifier K(+) current, a small slowly-activated K(+) current, a Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current, an ATP-sensitive K(+) current, a plasma membrane calcium-pump current and a Na(+) background current. This model, coupled with an equation describing intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, replicates beta-cell AP and Ca(2+) changes during one glucose-induced spontaneous spike, the effects of blocking K(+) currents with different inhibitors, and specific complex spike in mouse islets lacking Kv2.1 channels. The currents with voltage-independent gating variables can also be responsible for burst behavior. Original features of this model include new equations for L-type Ca(2+) current, assessment of the role of rapid delayed-rectifier K(+) current, and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents, demonstrating the important roles of the Ca(2+)-pump and background currents in the APs and bursts.

	Abstract = {Oscillatory phenomenon in electrical activity and cytoplasmic calcium concentration in response to glucose are intimately connected to multiple key aspects of pancreatic β-cell physiology. However, there is no single model for oscillatory mechanisms in these cells. We set out to identify possible pacemaker candidates for burst activity and cytoplasmic Ca(2+) oscillations in these cells by analyzing published hypotheses, their corresponding mathematical models, and relevant experimental data. We found that although no single pacemaker can account for the variety of oscillatory phenomena in β-cells, at least several separate mechanisms can underlie specific kinds of oscillations. According to our analysis, slowly activating Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels can be responsible for very fast Ca(2+) oscillations; changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and in the endoplasmic reticulum calcium concentration can be pacemakers for both fast bursts and cytoplasmic calcium oscillations, and cyclical cytoplasmic Na(+) changes may underlie patterning of slow calcium oscillations. However, these mechanisms still lack direct confirmation, and their potential interactions raises new issues. Further studies supported by improved mathematical models are necessary to understand oscillatory phenomena in β-cell physiology.},

	Abstract = {In mammals an increase in glucose leads to block of ATP dependent potassium channels in pancreatic β cells leading to membrane depolarization. This leads to the repetitive firing of action potentials that increases calcium influx and triggers insulin granule exocytosis. Several important differences between species in this process suggest that a dedicated human-oriented approach is advantageous as extrapolating from rodent data may be misleading in several respects. We examined depolarization-induced spike activity in pancreatic human islet-attached β-cells employing whole-cell patch-clamp methods. We also reviewed the literature concerning regulation of insulin secretion by channel activity and constructed a data-based computer model of human β cell function. The model couples the Hodgkin-Huxley-type ionic equations to the equations describing intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis and insulin release. On the basis of this model we employed computational simulations to better understand the behavior of action potentials, calcium handling and insulin secretion in human β cells under a wide range of experimental conditions. This computational system approach provides a framework to analyze the mechanisms of human β cell insulin secretion.},

	Abstract = {[Ca2+]i oscillations have been described in a variety of cells. This study focuses on caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Previous work has shown that these oscillations require Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release from a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive store. The aim of the study was to understand the mechanism responsible for the oscillations. As a starting point, [Ca2+]i relaxations were examined after membrane depolarization and exposure to caffeine. For both stimuli, post-stimulus relaxations could be described by the sum of two decaying exponential functions, consistent with a one-pool system in which Ca2+ transport between compartments is regulated by linear Ca2+ pumps and leaks. After modifying the store to include a [Ca2+]i-sensitive leak, the model also exhibits oscillations such as those observed experimentally. The model was tested by comparing measured and predicted net Ca2+ fluxes during the oscillatory cycle. Three independent fluxes were measured, describing the rates of 1) Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, 2) Ca2+ release by the internal store, and 3) Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane and uptake by the internal store. Starting with estimates of the model parameters deduced from post-stimulus relaxations and the rapid upstroke, a set of parameter values was found that provides a good description of [Ca2+]i throughout the oscillatory cycle. With the same parameter values, there was also good agreement between the measured and simulated net fluxes. Thus, a one-pool model with a single [Ca2+]i-sensitive Ca2+ permeability is adequate to account for many of the quantitative properties of steady-state [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Inactivation of the intracellular Ca2+ permeability, cooperative nonlinear Ca2+ uptake and extrusion mechanisms, and functional links between plasma membrane Ca2+ transport and the internal store are not required.},

	Abstract = {Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a recently described Ca2+ mobilizing messenger. First described in the sea urchin egg, it has been shown to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores. It is a remarkably potent molecule, and recent reports show that its cellular levels change in response to a variety of agonists confirming its role as a Ca2+ mobilizing messenger. In many cases NAADP interacts with other Ca2+ mobilizing messengers such as inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3 and cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) in shaping cytosolic Ca2+ signals. What is not clear is the molecular nature of the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanism and its sub-cellular localization. In this review we focus on the recent progress made in sea urchin eggs, which indicates that NAADP activates a novel Ca2+ release channel distinct from the relatively well-characterized IP3 and ryanodine receptors. Furthermore, in the sea urchin egg, the NAADP-sensitive store appears to be separate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is most likely an acidic store. These findings have also been reinforced by similar findings by some in mammalian cells. Finally, we discuss ongoing strategies to characterise NAADP-binding proteins which will greatly enhance our understanding of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signalling, and lead to the development of more selective tools to probe the role of this messenger.},

	Abstract = {Of the established Ca(2+) mobilizing messengers, NAADP is arguably the most tantalizing. It is the most potent, often efficacious at low nanomolar concentrations. Recent studies have identified a new class of calcium release channel, the two-pore channels (TPCs), as the likely targets for NAADP. These channels are endolysosomal in localization where they mediate local Ca(2+) release, and have highlighted a new role of acidic organelles as targets for messenger-evoked Ca(2+) mobilization. Three distinct roles of TPCs have been identified. The first is to effect local Ca(2+) release that may play a role in endolysosomal function including vesicular fusion and trafficking. The second is to trigger global calcium release by recruiting Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) channels at lysosomal-ER junctions. The third is to regulate plasma membrane excitability by the targeting of Ca(2+) release from appropriately positioned subplasma membrane stores to regulate plasma membrane Ca(2+)-activated channels. In this review, I discuss the role of NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release from endolysosomal stores as a widespread trigger for intracellular calcium signaling mechanisms, and how studies of TPCs are beginning to enhance our understanding of the central role of lysosomes in Ca(2+) signaling.},

	Abstract = {In hepatocytes, hormones linked to the formation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) evoke transient increases or spikes in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i), that increase in frequency with the agonist concentration. These oscillatory Ca2+ signals are thought to transmit the information encoded in the extracellular stimulus to down-stream Ca2+-sensitive metabolic processes. We have utilized both confocal and wide field fluorescence microscopy techniques to study the InsP3-dependent signaling pathway at the cellular and subcellular levels in the intact perfused liver. Typically InsP3-dependent [Ca2+]i spikes manifest as Ca2+ waves that propagate throughout the entire cytoplasm and nucleus, and in the intact liver these [Ca2+]i increases are conveyed through gap junctions to encompass entire lobular units. The translobular movement of Ca2+ provides a means to coordinate the function of metabolic zones of the lobule and thus, liver function. In this article, we describe the characteristics of agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i signals in the liver and discuss possible mechanisms to explain the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves in the intact organ.},

	Abstract = {Receptor-mediated oscillations in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) could originate either directly from an autonomous Ca(2+) feedback oscillator at the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor or as a secondary consequence of IP3 oscillations driven by Ca(2+) feedback on IP3 metabolism. It is challenging to discriminate these alternatives, because IP3 fluctuations could drive Ca(2+) oscillations or could just be a secondary response to the [Ca(2+)]i spikes. To investigate this problem, we constructed a recombinant IP3 buffer using type-I IP3 receptor ligand-binding domain fused to GFP (GFP-LBD), which buffers IP3 in the physiological range. This IP3 buffer slows hormone-induced [IP3] dynamics without changing steady-state [IP3]. GFP-LBD perturbed [Ca(2+)]i oscillations in a dose-dependent manner: it decreased both the rate of [Ca(2+)]i rise and the speed of Ca(2+) wave propagation and, at high levels, abolished [Ca(2+)]i oscillations completely. These data, together with computational modeling, demonstrate that IP3 dynamics play a fundamental role in generating [Ca(2+)]i oscillations and waves.},

	Abstract = {The local control theory of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling asserts that regulation of calcium (Ca(2+)) release occurs at the nanodomain level, where openings of single L-type Ca(2+) channels (LCCs) trigger openings of small clusters of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) co-localized within the dyad. A consequence of local control is that the whole-cell Ca(2+) transient is a smooth continuous function of influx of Ca(2+) through LCCs. While this so-called graded release property has been known for some time, its functional importance to the integrated behavior of the cardiac ventricular myocyte has not been fully appreciated. We previously formulated a biophysically based model, in which LCCs and RyRs interact via a coarse-grained representation of the dyadic space. The model captures key features of local control using a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. Voltage-dependent gain and graded Ca(2+) release are emergent properties of this model by virtue of the fact that model formulation is closely based on the sub-cellular basis of local control. In this current work, we have incorporated this graded release model into a prior model of guinea pig ventricular myocyte electrophysiology, metabolism, and isometric force production. The resulting integrative model predicts the experimentally observed causal relationship between action potential (AP) shape and timing of Ca(2+) and force transients, a relationship that is not explained by models lacking the graded release property. Model results suggest that even relatively subtle changes in AP morphology that may result, for example, from remodeling of membrane transporter expression in disease or spatial variation in cell properties, may have major impact on the temporal waveform of Ca(2+) transients, thus influencing tissue level electromechanical function.},

	Abstract = {Many mathematical models of calcium oscillations model buffering implicitly by using a rapid buffering approximation. This approximation assumes that separate time scales can be distinguished, with the buffer reactions occurring on a faster time scale than the other calcium fluxes. The rapid buffering approximation is convenient as it reduces the model to a single transport equation for calcium, but buffering is not always so fast. We investigated what happens if such an assumption is made for slower buffers for parameter values typical of both endogenous and exogenous buffers. We found that no qualitative differences are introduced to the bifurcation structure, i.e. there are no anomalous behaviour or artifacts in the dynamics when a rapid buffering approximation is used compared with including buffering explicitly in the model. We found that there exist distinct buffer parameter regions in which either the rapid buffering approximation or an assumption of no buffering could be used. Separating the two regions was a small transition region of buffer parameters for which care needs to be taken in modelling buffers. However, overall, the qualitative behaviour in all three regions was similar.},

Fluid flow is driven primarily by the transepithelial movement of chloride and sodium ions into the parotid acinus lumen. The activation of Cl(-) channels is calcium dependent, with the average elevated calcium concentration during calcium oscillations increasing the conductance of the channels, leading to an outflow of Cl(-). The accumulation of NaCl in the lumen drives water flow by osmosis. We construct a mathematical model of the calcium concentration oscillations and couple this to a model for Cl(-) efflux. We also construct a model governing fluid flow in an isolated parotid acinar cell, which includes a description of the rate of change of intracellular ion concentrations, cell volume, membrane potential and water flow rate. We find that [Ca(2+)] oscillations lead to oscillations in fluid flow, and that the rate of fluid flow is regulated by the average calcium concentration and not the frequency of the oscillations.},

We illustrate a parameter estimation method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, which can be used to fit directly to single-channel data, and determining, as an intrinsic part of the fit, the times at which the IPR is opening and closing.

	Abstract = {The current study provides biochemical and functional evidence that the targeting of protein kinase A (PKA) to sites of localized Ca(2+) release confers rapid, specific phosphoregulation of Ca(2+) signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. Regulatory control of Ca(2+) release by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptors was investigated by monitoring Ca(2+) dynamics in pancreatic acinar cells evoked by the flash photolysis of caged InsP(3) prior to and following PKA activation. Ca(2+) dynamics were imaged with high temporal resolution by digital imaging and electrophysiological methods. The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to introduce caged compounds and to record the activity of a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current. Photolysis of low concentrations of caged InsP(3) evoked Cl(-) currents that were inhibited by treatment with dibutryl-cAMP or forskolin. In contrast, PKA activators had no significant inhibitory effect on the activation of Cl(-) current evoked by uncaging Ca(2+) or by the photolytic release of higher concentrations of InsP(3). Treatment with Rp-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophoshorothioate, a selective inhibitor of PKA, or with Ht31, a peptide known to disrupt the targeting of PKA, largely abolished forskolin-induced inhibition of Ca(2+) release. Further evidence for the targeting of PKA to the sites of Ca(2+) mobilization was revealed using immunocytochemical methods demonstrating that the R(IIbeta) subunit of PKA was localized to the apical regions of acinar cells and co-immunoprecipitated with the type III but not the type I or type II InsP(3) receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that the pattern of signaling evoked by acetylcholine can be converted to one that is more "CCK-like" by raising cAMP levels. Our data provide a simple mechanism by which distinct oscillatory Ca(2+) patterns can be shaped.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of Ca(2+) release and Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents in two related, but functionally distinct exocrine cells, were studied to gain insight into how the molecular specialization of Ca(2+) signalling machinery are utilized to produce different physiological endpoints: in this case, fluid or exocytotic secretion. Digital imaging and patch-clamp methods were used to monitor the temporal and spatial properties of changes in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) and Cl(-) currents following the controlled photolytic release of caged-InsP(3) or caged-Ca(2+). In parotid and pancreatic acinar cells, changes in [Ca(2+)](c) and activation of a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current occurred with close temporal coincidence. In parotid, a rapid global Ca(2+) signal was invariably induced, even with low-level photolytic release of threshold amounts of InsP(3). In pancreas, threshold stimulation generated an apically delimited [Ca(2+)](c) signal, while a stronger stimulus induced a global [Ca(2+)](c) signal which exhibited characteristics of a propagating wave. InsP(3) was more effective in parotid, where [Ca(2+)](c) signals initiated with shorter latency and exhibited a faster time-to-peak than in pancreas. The increased potency of InsP(3) in parotid probably results from a four-fold higher number of InsP(3) receptors as measured by radiolabelled InsP(3) binding and western blot analysis. The Ca(2+) sensitivity of the Cl(-) channels in parotid and pancreas was determined from the [Ca(2+)]-current relationship measured during a dynamic 'Ca(2+) ramp' produced by the continuous, low-level photolysis of caged-Ca(2+). In addition to a greater number of InsP(3) receptors, the Cl(-) current density of parotid acinar cells was more than four-fold greater than that of pancreatic cells. Whereas activation of the current was tightly coupled to increases in Ca(2+) in both cell types, local Ca(2+) clearance was found to contribute substantially to the deactivation of the current in parotid. These data reveal specializations of common modules of Ca(2+)-release machinery and subsequent effector activation that are specifically suited to the distinct functional roles of these two related cell types.},

When the modifying enzymes operate outside the region of first-order kinetics, small percentage changes in the concentration of the effector controlling either of the modifying enzymes can give much larger percentage changes in the amount of modified protein. This amplification of the response to a stimulus can provide additional sensitivity in biological control, equivalent to that of allosteric proteins with high Hill coefficients.},

	Abstract = {Starting with a model for a product-activated enzymatic reaction proposed for glycolytic oscillations, we show how more complex oscillatory phenomena may develop when the basic model is modified by addition of product recycling into substrate or by coupling in parallel or in series two autocatalytic enzyme reactions. Among the new modes of behavior are the coexistence between two stable types of oscillations (birhythmicity), bursting, and aperiodic oscillations (chaos). On the basis of these results, we outline an empirical method for finding complex oscillatory phenomena in autonomous biochemical systems, not subjected to forcing by a periodic input. This procedure relies on finding in parameter space two domains of instability of the steady state and bringing them close to each other until they merge. Complex phenomena occur in or near the region where the two domains overlap. The method applies to the search for birhythmicity, bursting and chaos in a model for the cAMP signalling system of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae.},

	Abstract = {A system of differential equations describing stationary vasomotion is formulated. It incorporates the ionic transports, cell-membrane potential, muscle contraction of the vessel smooth muscle cells, and the mechanics of a thick-walled cylinder. It is shown that the interaction of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes mediated by voltage-gated and voltage-calcium-gated channels, respectively, brings about periodicity of those transports. This results on a time-periodic cytoplasmic calcium concentration, myosin light chains phosphorylation, and crossbridges formation with the attending muscle stress. The vessel's transmural pressure determines a hoop stress. The resultant hoop, elastic, and muscle stresses determine the rate of change of the vessel's diameter: vasomotion. The model results agree with the experimental observations. The sensitivity of the vasomotion's dependence on parameter values and its significance to experimental protocols are examined. Further, it is hypothesized that the dependence of calcium-channel openings on voltage is shifted by changes on transmural pressure. Thus, Harder's experimental results are reproduced, among them the decreasing of vessel diameter with increasing pressure. Those behaviors are associated with a pattern of change of the singularities of the system of equations describing the model. This suggests a functional relationship on the interactions of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes responsible for the myogenic response; it may not result from a single molecular mechanism. The model is constructed so that additional experimental information can be readily incorporated.},

	Abstract = {Glucagon hormone is synthesized and released by pancreatic α-cells, one of the islet-cell types. This hormone, along with insulin, maintains blood glucose levels within the physiological range. Glucose stimulates glucagon release at low concentrations (hypoglycemia). However, the mechanisms involved in this secretion are still not completely clear. Here, using experimental calcium time series obtained in mouse pancreatic islets at low and high glucose conditions, we propose a glucagon secretion model for α-cells. Our model takes into account that the resupply of releasable granules is not only controlled by cytoplasmic Ca2+, as in other neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, but also by the level of extracellular glucose. We found that, although calcium oscillations are highly variable, the average secretion rates predicted by the model fall into the range of values reported in the literature, for both stimulated and non-stimulated conditions. For low glucose levels, the model predicts that there would be a well-controlled number of releasable granules refilled slowly from a large reserve pool, probably to ensure a secretion rate that could last for several minutes. Studying the α-cell response to the addition of insulin at low glucose, we observe that the presence of insulin reduces glucagon release by decreasing the islet Ca2+ level. This observation is in line with previous work reporting that Ca2+ dynamics, mainly frequency, is altered by insulin. Thus, the present results emphasize the main role played by Ca2+ and glucose in the control of glucagon secretion by α-cells. Our modeling approach also shows that calcium oscillations potentiate glucagon secretion as compared to constant levels of this cellular messenger. Altogether, the model sheds new light on the subcellular mechanisms involved in α-cell exocytosis, and provides a quantitative predictive tool for studying glucagon secretion modulators in physiological and pathological conditions.},

	Abstract = {We use a core molecular model capable of generating circadian rhythms to assess the robustness of circadian oscillations with respect to molecular noise. The model is based on the negative feedback exerted by a regulatory protein on the expression of its gene. Such a negative regulatory mechanism underlies circadian oscillations of the PER protein in Drosophila and of the FRQ protein in Neurospora. The model incorporates gene transcription into mRNA, translation of mRNA into protein, reversible phosphorylation leading to degradation of the regulatory protein, transport of the latter into the nucleus, and repression of gene expression by the nuclear form of the protein. To assess the effect of molecular noise, we perform stochastic simulations after decomposing the deterministic model into elementary reaction steps. The oscillations predicted by the stochastic simulations agree with those obtained with the deterministic version of the model. We show that robust circadian oscillations can occur already with a limited number of mRNA and protein molecules, in the range of tens and hundreds, respectively. Entrainment by light/dark cycles and cooperativity in repression enhance the robustness of circadian oscillations with respect to molecular noise.},

	Abstract = {The Ca2+ + Mg2+-activated ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum exhibits complex kinetics of activation with respect to ATP. ATPase activity is pH-dependent, with similar pH-activity profiles at high and low concentrations of ATP. Low concentrations of Ca2+ in the micromolar range activate the ATPase, whereas activity is inhibited by Ca2+ at millimolar concentrations. The pH-dependence of this Ca2+ inhibition and the effect of the detergent C12E8 (dodecyl octaethylene glycol monoether) on Ca2+ inhibition are similar to those observed on activation by low concentrations of Ca2+. On the basis of these and other studies we present a kinetic model for the ATPase. The ATPase is postulated to exist in one of two conformations: a conformation (E1) of high affinity for Ca2+ and MgATP and a conformation (E2) of low affinity for Ca2+ and MgATP. Ca2+ binding to E2 and to the phosphorylated form E2P are equal. Proton binding at the Ca2+-binding sites in the E1 and E2 conformations explains the pH-dependence of Ca2+ effects. Binding of MgATP to the phosphorylated intermediate E1'PCa2 and to E2 modulate the rates of the transport step E1'PCa-E2'PCa2 and the return of the empty Ca2+ sites to the outside surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as the rate of dephosphorylation of E2P. Only a single binding site for MgATP is postulated.},

	Abstract = {The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in the induction of long-term postsynaptic modifications following calcium entry. Experiments suggest that these long-term synaptic changes are all-or-none switch-like events between discrete states. The biochemical network involving CaMKII and its regulating protein signaling cascade has been hypothesized to durably maintain the evoked synaptic state in the form of a bistable switch. However, it is still unclear whether experimental LTP/LTD protocols lead to corresponding transitions between the two states in realistic models of such a network. We present a detailed biochemical model of the CaMKII autophosphorylation and the protein signaling cascade governing the CaMKII dephosphorylation. As previously shown, two stable states of the CaMKII phosphorylation level exist at resting intracellular calcium concentration, and high calcium transients can switch the system from the weakly phosphorylated (DOWN) to the highly phosphorylated (UP) state of the CaMKII (similar to a LTP event). We show here that increased CaMKII dephosphorylation activity at intermediate Ca(2+) concentrations can lead to switching from the UP to the DOWN state (similar to a LTD event). This can be achieved if protein phosphatase activity promoting CaMKII dephosphorylation activates at lower Ca(2+) levels than kinase activity. Finally, it is shown that the CaMKII system can qualitatively reproduce results of plasticity outcomes in response to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and presynaptic stimulation protocols. This shows that the CaMKII protein network can account for both induction, through LTP/LTD-like transitions, and storage, due to its bistability, of synaptic changes.},

The common property of the discussed models is that synaptic changes depend on the dynamics of the intracellular calcium concentration, which itself depends on pre- and postsynaptic activity. We start by discussing simple models in which plasticity changes are based directly on calcium amplitude and dynamics. We then consider models in which dynamic intracellular signaling cascades form the link between the calcium dynamics and the plasticity changes. Both mechanisms of induction of STDP (through the ability of pre/postsynaptic spikes to evoke changes in the state of the synapse) and of maintenance of the evoked changes (through bistability) are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Multiple stimulation protocols have been found to be effective in changing synaptic efficacy by inducing long-term potentiation or depression. In many of those protocols, increases in postsynaptic calcium concentration have been shown to play a crucial role. However, it is still unclear whether and how the dynamics of the postsynaptic calcium alone determine the outcome of synaptic plasticity. Here, we propose a calcium-based model of a synapse in which potentiation and depression are activated above calcium thresholds. We show that this model gives rise to a large diversity of spike timing-dependent plasticity curves, most of which have been observed experimentally in different systems. It accounts quantitatively for plasticity outcomes evoked by protocols involving patterns with variable spike timing and firing rate in hippocampus and neocortex. Furthermore, it allows us to predict that differences in plasticity outcomes in different studies are due to differences in parameters defining the calcium dynamics. The model provides a mechanistic understanding of how various stimulation protocols provoke specific synaptic changes through the dynamics of calcium concentration and thresholds implementing in simplified fashion protein signaling cascades, leading to long-term potentiation and long-term depression. The combination of biophysical realism and analytical tractability makes it the ideal candidate to study plasticity at the synapse, neuron, and network levels.},

	Abstract = {The local control theory of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in cardiac muscle asserts that L-type Ca(2+) current tightly controls Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via local interaction of closely apposed L-type Ca(2+) channels (LCCs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). These local interactions give rise to smoothly graded Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR), which exhibits high gain. In this study we present a biophysically detailed model of the normal canine ventricular myocyte that conforms to local control theory. The model formulation incorporates details of microscopic EC coupling properties in the form of Ca(2+) release units (CaRUs) in which individual sarcolemmal LCCs interact in a stochastic manner with nearby RyRs in localized regions where junctional SR membrane and transverse-tubular membrane are in close proximity. The CaRUs are embedded within and interact with the global systems of the myocyte describing ionic and membrane pump/exchanger currents, SR Ca(2+) uptake, and time-varying cytosolic ion concentrations to form a model of the cardiac action potential (AP). The model can reproduce both the detailed properties of EC coupling, such as variable gain and graded SR Ca(2+) release, and whole-cell phenomena, such as modulation of AP duration by SR Ca(2+) release. Simulations indicate that the local control paradigm predicts stable APs when the L-type Ca(2+) current is adjusted in accord with the balance between voltage- and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation processes as measured experimentally, a scenario where common pool models become unstable. The local control myocyte model provides a means for studying the interrelationship between microscopic and macroscopic behaviors in a manner that would not be possible in experiments.},

	Abstract = {It is now well established that characteristic properties of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in cardiac myocytes, such as high gain and graded Ca(2+) release, arise from the interactions that occur between L-type Ca(2+) channels (LCCs) and nearby ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) release channels (RyRs) in localized microdomains. Descriptions of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) that account for these local mechanisms are lacking from many previous models of the cardiac action potential, and those that do include local control of CICR are able to reconstruct properties of EC coupling, but require computationally demanding stochastic simulations of approximately 10(5) individual ion channels. In this study, we generalize a recently developed analytical approach for deriving simplified mechanistic models of CICR to formulate an integrative model of the canine cardiac myocyte which is computationally efficient. The resulting model faithfully reproduces experimentally measured properties of EC coupling and whole cell phenomena. The model is used to study the role of local redundancy in L-type Ca(2+) channel gating and the role of dyad configuration on EC coupling. Simulations suggest that the characteristic steep rise in EC coupling gain observed at hyperpolarized potentials is a result of increased functional coupling between LCCs and RyRs. We also demonstrate mechanisms by which alterations in the early repolarization phase of the action potential, resulting from reduction of the transient outward potassium current, alters properties of EC coupling.},

A pulse could either delay or advance the time of occurrence of the next action potential, depending on whether it fell early or late in the cycle. As the stimulus amplitude was increased, the transition from delay to advance occurred over a narrower range of coupling intervals. At low-stimulus amplitudes the transition from delay to advance occurred in a smooth continuous fashion; at medium-stimulus amplitudes the transition was discontinuous; at high-stimulus amplitudes graded action potentials were seen. It was impossible to annihilate spontaneous activity in aggregates with a single stimulus. The phase-resetting response to hyperpolarizing pulses was qualitatively the reverse of that produced by depolarizing pulses. A very high-amplitude depolarizing or hyperpolarizing pulse could produce rapid repetitive activity. Theoretical aspects of these phenomena are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Hormones such as glucagon are secreted by Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis of large dense-core vesicles, but the mechanisms involved have only been partially elucidated. Studies of pancreatic beta-cells secreting insulin revealed that synaptotagmin-7 alone is not sufficient to mediate Ca(2+)-dependent insulin granule exocytosis, and studies of chromaffin cells secreting neuropeptides and catecholamines showed that synaptotagmin-1 and -7 collaborate as Ca(2+) sensors for exocytosis, and that both are equally involved. As no other peptide secretion was analysed, it remains unclear whether synaptotagmins generally act as Ca(2+) sensors in large dense-core vesicle exocytosis in endocrine cells, and if so, whether synaptotagmin-7 always functions with a partner in that role. In particular, far less is known about the mechanisms underlying Ca(2+)-triggered glucagon release from alpha-cells than insulin secretion from beta-cells, even though insulin and glucagon together regulate blood glucose levels. To address these issues, we analysed the role of synaptotagmins in Ca(2+)-triggered glucagon exocytosis. Surprisingly, we find that deletion of a single synaptotagmin isoform, synaptotagmin-7, nearly abolished Ca(2+)-triggered glucagon secretion. Moreover, single-cell capacitance measurements confirmed that pancreatic alpha-cells lacking synaptotagmin-7 exhibited little Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis, whereas all other physiological and morphological parameters of the alpha-cells were normal. Our data thus identify synaptotagmin-7 as a principal Ca(2+) sensor for glucagon secretion, and support the notion that synaptotagmins perform a universal but selective function as individually acting Ca(2+) sensors in neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and hormone secretion.},

	Abstract = {The level of Ca inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is an important determinant of functional activity of the Ca release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR) in cardiac muscle. However, the molecular basis of RyR regulation by luminal Ca remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the potential role of the cardiac SR luminal auxiliary proteins calsequestrin (CSQ), triadin 1, and junctin in forming the luminal calcium sensor for the cardiac RyR. Recordings of single RyR channels incorporated into lipid bilayers, from either SR vesicle or purified RyR preparations, were performed in the presence of MgATP using Cs+ as the charge carrier. Raising luminal [Ca] from 20 microM to 5 mM increased the open channel probability (Po) of native RyRs in SR vesicles, but not of purified RyRs. Adding CSQ to the luminal side of the purified channels produced no significant changes in Po, nor did it restore the ability of RyRs to respond to luminal Ca. When triadin 1 and junctin were added to the luminal side of purified channels, RyR Po increased significantly; however, the channels still remained unresponsive to changes in luminal [Ca]. In RyRs reassociated with triadin 1 and junctin, adding luminal CSQ produced a significant decrease in activity. After reassociation with all three proteins, RyRs responded to rises of luminal [Ca] by increasing their Po. These results suggest that a complex of CSQ, triadin 1, and junctin confer RyR luminal Ca sensitivity. CSQ apparently serves as a luminal Ca sensor that inhibits the channel at low luminal [Ca], whereas triadin 1 and/or junctin may be required to mediate interactions of CSQ with RyR.},

	Abstract = {In airway myocytes, like in many cells, Ca(2+) signaling is controlled by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) via InsP(3) receptors (InsP(3)R) located in the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum. Three types of InsP(3)R exist, labeled Types 1, 2, and 3, which differ in their gating kinetics. We analyze a possible impact of the different gating kinetics of Type 1 and Type 3 InsP(3)R on the time course of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in tracheal smooth muscle cells upon agonist stimulation. Previous experimental data in rat tracheal myocytes showed that upon gradually increased stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh), a contractile agonist that acts via InsP(3) production, signal spikes, several spikes with declining maxima, and sustained oscillations appear. Our model reproduces the time courses of cytosolic Ca(2+) measured in tracheal myocytes. Moreover, by postulating slight variations in the model parameters which determine the total number of receptors expressed and the ratio between Type 1 and Type 3 InsP(3)R, it offers an explanation to the experimental observation of qualitatively different responses of cells within a presumably homogeneous tissue.},

	Abstract = {Many arteries and arterioles exhibit rhythmical contractions which are synchronous over considerable distances. This vasomotion is likely to assist in tissue perfusion especially during periods of altered metabolism or perfusion pressure. While the mechanism underlying vascular rhythmicity has been investigated for many years, it has only been recently, with the advent of imaging techniques for visualizing intracellular calcium release, that significant advances have been made. These methods, when combined with mechanical and electrophysiological recordings, have demonstrated that the rhythm depends critically on calcium released from intracellular stores within the smooth muscle cells and on cell coupling via gap junctions to synchronize oscillations in calcium release amongst adjacent cells. While these factors are common to all vessels studied to date, the contribution of voltage-dependent channels and the endothelium varies amongst different vessels. The basic mechanism for rhythmical activity in arteries thus differs from its counterpart in non-vascular smooth muscle, where specific networks of pacemaker cells generate electrical potentials which drive activity within the otherwise quiescent muscle cells.},

	Abstract = {The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) is the main calcium(Ca2+) release channel in most tissues. Three isoforms have been identified, but only types I and II InsP3R have been characterized. Here we examine the functional properties of the type III InsP3R because this receptor is restricted to the trigger zone from which Ca2+ waves originate and it has distinctive InsP3-binding properties. We find that type III InsP3R forms Ca2+ channels with single-channel currents that are similar to those of type I InsP3R; however, the open probability of type III InsP3R isoform increases monotonically with increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, whereas the type I isoform has a bell-shaped dependence on cytoplasmic Ca2+. The properties of type III InsP3R provide positive feedback as Ca2+ is released; the lack of negative feedback allows complete Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Thus, activation of type III InsP3R in cells that express only this isoform results in a single transient, but global, increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+. The bell-shaped Ca2+-dependence curve of type I InsP3R is ideal for supporting Ca2+ oscillations, whereas the properties of type III InsP3R are better suited to signal initiation.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a minimum kinetic model for cross-bridge interactions with the thin filament in smooth muscle. The model hypothesizes two types of cross-bridge interactions: 1) cycling phosphorylated cross bridges and 2) noncycling dephosphorylated cross bridges ("latch bridges"). The major assumptions are that 1) Ca2+-dependent myosin phosphorylation is the only postulated regulatory mechanism, 2) each myosin head acts independently, and 3) latch bridges are formed by dephosphorylation of an attached cross bridge. Rate constants were resolved by fitting data on the time courses of myosin phosphorylation and stress development. Comparison of the rate constants indicates that latch-bridge detachment is the rate-limiting step. Model simulations predicted a hyperbolic dependence of steady-state stress on myosin phosphorylation, which corresponded with the experimental observation of high values of stress with low levels of phosphorylation in intact tissues. Model simulations also predicted the experimental observation that an initial phosphorylation transient only accelerates stress development, with no effect on the final steady-state levels of stress. Because the only Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism in this model was activation of myosin light chain kinase, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that myosin phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for the development of the latch state.},

	Abstract = {We have proposed a model that incorporates a dephosphorylated "latch bridge" to explain the mechanics and energetics of smooth muscle. Cross-bridge phosphorylation is proposed as a prerequisite for cross-bridge attachment and rapid cycling. Features of the model are 1) myosin light chain kinase and phosphatase can act on both free and attached cross bridges, 2) dephosphorylation of an attached phosphorylated cross bridge produces a noncycling "latch bridge," and 3) latch bridges have a slow detachment rate. This model quantitatively predicts the latch state: stress maintenance with reduced phosphorylation, cross-bridge cycling rates, and ATP consumption. In this study, we adapted A. F. Huxley's formulation of crossbridge cycling (A. F. Huxley, Progr. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 7: 255-318, 1957) to the latch-bridge model to predict the relationship between isotonic shortening velocity and phosphorylation. The model successfully predicted the linear dependence of maximum shortening velocity at zero external load (V0) on phosphorylation, as well as the family of stress-velocity curves determined at different times during a contraction when phosphorylation values varied. The model implies that it is unnecessary to invoke an internal load or multiple regulatory mechanisms to explain regulation of V0 in smooth muscle.},

	Abstract = {Triggered release of Ca2+ from an individual sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release unit (CRU) is the fundamental event of cardiac excitation--contraction coupling, and spontaneous release events (sparks) are the major contributor to diastolic Ca(2+) leak in cardiomyocytes. Previous model studies have predicted that the duration and magnitude of the spark is determined by the local CRU geometry, as well as the localization and density of Ca(2+) handling proteins. We have created a detailed computational model of a CRU, and developed novel tools to generate the computational geometry from electron tomographic images. Ca(2+) diffusion was modelled within the SR and the cytosol to examine the effects of localization and density of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 (SERCA), and calsequestrin on spark dynamics. We reconcile previous model predictions of approximately 90% local Ca(2+) depletion in junctional SR, with experimental reports of about 40%. This analysis supports the hypothesis that dye kinetics and optical averaging effects can have a significant impact on measures of spark dynamics. Our model also predicts that distributing calsequestrin within non-junctional Z-disc SR compartments, in addition to the junctional compartment, prolongs spark release time as reported by Fluo5. By pumping Ca(2+) back into the SR during a release, SERCA is able to prolong a Ca(2+) spark, and this may contribute to SERCA-dependent changes in Ca(2+) wave speed. Finally, we show that including the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger inside the dyadic cleft does not alter local [Ca(2+)] during a spark.},

U.S.A. 103, 1675-1680 (2006)] that the mechanisms underlying the generation and control of such oscillations can be determined by means of a simple experiment, whereby a single exogenous pulse of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) is applied to the cell. However, more detailed mathematical investigations [M. Domijan et al., &quot;Dynamical probing of the mechanisms underlying calcium oscillations,&quot; J. Nonlinear Sci. 16, 483-506 (2006)] have shown that this is not necessarily always true, and that the experimental data are more difficult to interpret than first thought. Here, we use geometric singular perturbation techniques to study the dynamics of models that make different assumptions about the mechanisms underlying the calcium oscillations. In particular, we show how recently developed canard theory for singularly perturbed systems with three or more slow variables [M. Wechselberger, &quot;A propos de canards (Apropos canards),&quot; Preprint, 2010] applies to these calcium models and how the presence of a curve of folded singularities and corresponding canards can result in anomalous delays in the response of these models to a pulse of IP(3).},

	Abstract = {Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons integrate the multiple internal and external cues that regulate sexual reproduction. In contrast to other neurons that exhibit extensive dendritic arbors, GnRH neurons usually have a single dendrite with relatively little branching. This largely precludes the integration strategy in which a single dendritic branch serves as a unit of integration. In the present study, we identify a gradient in L-type calcium channels in dendrites of mouse GnRH neurons and its interaction with GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs. Higher levels of L-type calcium channels are in somata/proximal dendrites (i.e., 0-26 μm) and distal dendrites (∼130 μm dendrite length), but intervening midlengths of dendrite (∼27-130 μm) have reduced L-type calcium channels. Using uncaging of GABA, there is a decreasing GABAergic influence along the dendrite and the impact of GABA(A) receptors is dependent on activation of L-type calcium channels. This results in amplification of proximal GABAergic signals and attenuation of distal dendritic signals. Most interestingly, the intervening dendritic regions create a filter through which only relatively high-amplitude, low-frequency GABAergic signaling to dendrites elicits action potentials. The findings of the present study suggest that GnRH dendrites adopt an integration strategy whereby segments of single nonbranching GnRH dendrites create functional microdomains and thus serve as units of integration.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) promoter-driven transgenics in the mouse are beginning to open up the once elusive GnRH neuronal phenotype to detailed molecular and cellular investigation. This review highlights progress in the development of GnRH promoter transgenic constructs and the understanding of murine gene sequences required for the correct temporal and spatial targeting of transgenes to the GnRH phenotype in vivo. Strategies enabling the identification of single, living GnRH neurons in the acute brain slice preparation are allowing gene profiling and electrophysiological experiments to be undertaken. Results so far indicate that, like other neurons, GnRH cells express a variety of sodium, potassium and calcium channels as well as GABAergic and glutamatergic receptors which are responsible for determining the membrane properties and firing characteristics of the GnRH neuron. Many of these receptors and channels appear to be expressed heterogeneously within the GnRH phenotype. Furthermore, several display distinct postnatal developmental expression profiles which are likely to be of consequence to the development of synchronized, pulsatile GnRH secretion in the adult animal.},

	Abstract = {Calcium channels carry out vital functions in a wide variety of excitable cells but they also face special challenges. In the medium outside the channel, Ca2+ ions are vastly outnumbered by other ions. Thus, the calcium channel must be extremely selective if it is to allow Ca2+ influx rather than a general cation influx. In fact, calcium channels show a much greater selectivity for Ca2+ than sodium channels do for Na+ despite the high flux that open Ca channels can support. Relatively little is known about the mechanism of ion permeation through Ca channels. Earlier models assumed ion independence or single-ion occupancy. Here we present evidence for a novel hypothesis of ion movement through Ca channels, based on measurements of Ca channel activity at the level of single cells or single channels. Our results indicate that under physiological conditions, the channel is occupied almost continually by one or more Ca2+ ions which, by electrostatic repulsion, guard the channel against permeation by other ions. On the other hand, repulsion between Ca2+ ions allows high throughput rates and tends to prevent saturation with calcium.},

	Abstract = {Microdomains of calcium (i.e., areas on the nanometer scale that have qualitatively different calcium concentrations from that in the bulk cytosol) are known to be important in many situations. In cardiac cells, for instance, a calcium microdomain between the L-type channels and the ryanodine receptors, the so-called diadic cleft, is where the majority of the control of calcium release occurs. In other cell types that exhibit calcium oscillations and waves, the importance of microdomains in the vicinity of clusters of inositol trisphosphate receptors, or between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other internal organelles or the plasma membrane, is clear. Given the limits of computational power, it is not currently realistic to model an entire cellular cytoplasm by incorporating detailed structural information about the ER throughout the entire cytoplasm. Hence, most models use a homogenised approach, assuming that both cytoplasm and ER coexist at each point of the domain. Conversely, microdomain models can be constructed, in which detailed structural information can be incorporated, but, until now, methods have not been developed for linking such a microdomain model to a model at the level of the entire cell. Using the homogenisation approach we developed in an earlier paper [Goel, P., Friedman, A., Sneyd, J., 2006. Homogenization of the cell cytoplasm: the calcium bidomain equations. SIAM J. Multiscale Modeling Simulation, in press] we show how a multiscale model of a calcium microdomain can be constructed. In this model a detailed model of the microdomain (in which the ER and the cytoplasm are separate compartments) is coupled to a homogenised model of the entire cell in a rigorous way. Our method is illustrated by a simple model of the diadic cleft of a cardiac half-sarcomere.},

	Abstract = {Na+/Ca2+ exchange is electrogenic and moves one net positive charge per cycle. Although the cardiac exchanger has a three-to-one Na+/Ca2+ stoichiometry, details of the reaction cycle are not well defined. Here we associate Na+ translocation by the cardiac exchanger with positive charge movement in giant membrane patches from cardiac myocytes and oocytes expressing the cloned cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The charge movements are initiated by step increments of the cytoplasmic Na+ concentration in the absence of Ca2+. Giant patches from control oocytes lack both steady-state Na+/Ca2+ exchange current (INaCa) and Na(+)-induced charge movements. Charge movements indicate about 400 exchangers per micron 2 in guinea-pig sarcolemma. Fully activated INaCa densities (20-30 microA cm-2) indicate maximum turnover rates of 5,000 s-1. As has been predicted for consecutive exchange models, the apparent ion affinities of steady state INaCa increase as the counterion concentrations are decreased. Consistent with an electroneutral Ca2+ translocation, we find that voltage dependence of INaCa in both directions is lost as Ca2+ concentration is decreased. The principal electrogenic step seems to be at the extracellular end of the Na+ translocation pathway.},

	Abstract = {Sodium-calcium exchange current was isolated in inside-out patches excised from guinea pig ventricular cells using the giant patch method. The outward exchange current decayed exponentially upon activation by cytoplasmic sodium (sodium-dependent inactivation). The kinetics and mechanism of the inactivation were studied. (a) The rate of inactivation and the peak current amplitude were both strongly temperature dependent (Q10 = 2.2). (b) An increase in cytoplasmic pH from 6.8 to 7.8 attenuated the current decay and shifted the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of cytoplasmic calcium for secondary activation of the exchange current from 9.6 microM to &lt; 0.3 microM. (c) The amplitude of exchange current decreased synchronously over the membrane potential range from -120 to 60 mV during the inactivation, indicating that voltage dependence of the exchanger did not change during the inactivation process. The voltage dependence of exchange current also did not change during secondary modulation by cytoplasmic calcium and activation by chymotrypsin. (d) In the presence of 150 mM extracellular sodium and 2 mM extracellular calcium, outward exchange current decayed similarly upon application of cytoplasmic sodium. Upon removal of cytoplasmic sodium in the presence of 2-5 microM cytoplasmic free calcium, the inward exchange current developed in two phases, a fast phase within the time course of solution changes, and a slow phase (tau approximately 4 s) indicative of recovery from sodium-dependent inactivation. (e) Under zero-trans conditions, the inward current was fully activated within solution switch times upon application of cytoplasmic calcium and did not decay. (f) The slow recovery phase of inward current upon removal of cytoplasmic sodium was also present under the zero-trans condition. (g) Sodium-dependent inactivation shows little or no dependence on membrane potential in guinea pig myocyte sarcolemma. (h) Sodium-dependent inactivation of outward current is attenuated in rate and extent as extracellular calcium is decreased. (i) Kinetics of the sodium-dependent inactivation and its dependence on major experimental variables are well described by a simple two-state inactivation model assuming one fully active and one fully inactive exchanger state, whereby the transition to the inactive state takes place from a fully sodium-loaded exchanger conformation with cytoplasmic orientation of binding sites (E1.3Ni).},

	Abstract = {Calcium sparks are local regenerative releases of Ca(2+) from a cluster of ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. During excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac cells, Ca(2+) sparks are triggered by Ca(2+) entering the cell via the T-tubules (Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release). However under conditions of calcium overload, Ca(2+) sparks can be triggered spontaneously. The exact process by which Ca(2+) sparks terminate is still an open question, although both deterministic and stochastic processes are likely to be important. In this article, asymptotic methods are used to analyze a single Ca(2+) spark model, which includes both deterministic and stochastic biophysical mechanisms. The analysis calculates both spark frequencies and spark duration distributions, and shows under what circumstances stochastic transitions are important. Additionally, a model of the coupling of the release channels via the FK-binding protein is analyzed.},

	Abstract = {Intercellular regenerative calcium waves in systems such as the liver and the blowfly salivary gland have been hypothesized to spread through calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and gap-junctional calcium diffusion. A simple mathematical model of this mechanism is developed. It includes CICR and calcium removal from the cytoplasm, cytoplasmic and gap-junctional calcium diffusion, and calcium buffering. For a piecewise linear approximation of the calcium kinetics, expressions in terms of the cellular parameters are derived for 1) the condition for the propagation of intercellular waves, and 2) the characteristic time of the delay of a wave encountered at the gap junctions. Intercellular propagation relies on the local excitation of CICR in the perijunctional space by gap-junctional calcium influx. This mechanism is compatible with low effective calcium diffusivity, and necessitates that CICR can be excited in every cell along the path of a wave. The gap-junctional calcium permeability required for intercellular waves in the model falls in the range of reported gap-junctional permeability values. The concentration of diffusive cytoplasmic calcium buffers and the maximal rate of CICR, in the case of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor calcium release channels set by the IP(3) concentration, are shown to be further determinants of wave behavior.},

	Abstract = {Intercellular Ca2+ waves in astrocytes are thought to serve as a pathway of long-range signaling. The waves can propagate by the diffusion of molecules through gap junctions and across the extracellular space. In rat striatal astrocytes, the gap-junctional route was shown to be dominant. To analyze the interplay of the processes involved in wave propagation, a mathematical model of this system has been developed. The kinetic description of Ca2+ signaling within a single cell accounts for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation, including its activation by cytoplasmic Ca2+, IP3-induced Ca2+ liberation from intracellular stores and various other Ca2+ transports, and cytoplasmic diffusion of IP3 and Ca2+. When cells are coupled by gap junction channels in a two-dimensional array, IP3 generation in one cell triggers Ca2+ waves propagating across some tens of cells. The spatial range of wave propagation is limited, yet depends sensitively on the Ca2+-mediated regeneration of the IP3 signal. Accordingly, the term "limited regenerative signaling" is proposed. The gap-junctional permeability for IP3 is the crucial permissive factor for wave propagation, and heterogeneity of gap-junctional coupling yields preferential pathways of wave propagation. Processes involved in both signal initiation (activation of IP3 production caused by receptor agonist) and regeneration (activation of IP3 production by Ca2+, loading of the Ca2+ stores) are found to exert the main control on the wave range. The refractory period of signaling strongly depends on the refilling kinetics of the Ca2+ stores. Thus the model identifies multiple steps that may be involved in the regulation of this intercellular signaling pathway.},

	Abstract = {The flow of current through an ionic channel is studied using the energetic variational approach of Liu applied to the primitive (implicit solvent) model of ionic solutions. This approach allows the derivation of self-consistent (Euler-Lagrange) equations to describe the flow of spheres through channels. The partial differential equations derived involve the global interactions of the spheres and are replaced here with a local approximation that we call steric PNP (Poisson-Nernst-Planck) (Lin, T. C.; Eisenberg, B. To be submitted for publication, 2012). Kong combining rules are used and a range of values of steric interaction parameters are studied. These parameters change the energetics of steric interaction but have no effect on diffusion coefficients in models and simulations. Calculations are made for the calcium (EEEE, EEEA) and sodium channels (DEKA) previously studied in Monte Carlo simulations with comparable results. The biological function is quite sensitive to the steric interaction parameters, and we speculate that a wide range of the function of channels and transporters, even enzymes, might depend on such terms. We point out that classical theories of channels, transporters, and enzymes depend on ideal representations of ionic solutions in which nothing interacts with nothing, even in the enormous concentrations found near and in these proteins or near electrodes in electrochemical cells for that matter. We suggest that a theory designed to handle interactions might be more appropriate. We show that one such theory is feasible and computable: steric PNP allows a direct comparison with experiments measuring flows as well as equilibrium properties. Steric PNP combines atomic and macroscales in a computable formulation that allows the calculation of the macroscopic effects of changes in atomic scale structures (size ~/= 10(-10) meters) studied very extensively in channology and molecular biology.},

@article{horowitz2005,
	Abstract = {We have further tested the hypothesis that receptor-mediated modulation of KCNQ channels involves depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). We used four parallel assays to characterize the agonist-induced PLC response of cells (tsA or CHO cells) expressing M1 muscarinic receptors: translocation of two fluorescent probes for membrane lipids, release of calcium from intracellular stores, and chemical measurement of acidic lipids. Occupation of M1 receptors activates PLC and consumes cellular PIP2 in less than a minute and also partially depletes mono- and unphosphorylated phosphoinositides. KCNQ current is simultaneously suppressed. Two inhibitors of PLC, U73122 and edelfosine (ET-18-OCH3), can block the muscarinic actions completely, including suppression of KCNQ current. However, U73122 also had many side effects that were attributable to alkylation of various proteins. These were mimicked or occluded by prior reaction with the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide and included block of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and effects that resembled a weak activation of PLC or an inhibition of lipid kinases. By our functional criteria, the putative PLC activator m-3M3FBS did stimulate PLC, but with a delay and an irregular time course. It also suppressed KCNQ current. The M1 receptor-mediated activation of PLC and suppression of KCNQ current were stopped by lowering intracellular calcium well below resting levels and were slowed by not allowing intracellular calcium to rise in response to PLC activation. Thus calcium release induced by PLC activation feeds back immediately on PLC, accelerating it during muscarinic stimulation in strong positive feedback. These experiments clarify important properties of receptor-coupled PLC responses and their inhibition in the context of the living cell. In each test, the suppression of KCNQ current closely paralleled the expected fall of PIP2. The results are described by a kinetic model.},

@article{hosoi2007,
	Abstract = {Recruitment of release-ready vesicles at synapses is one of the important factors, which determine dynamic properties of signaling between neurons in the brain. It has been shown that the rate of vesicle recruitment is accelerated by strong synaptic activity. An elevated concentration of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal ([Ca2+]i) has been proposed to be responsible for this effect. However, the precise relationship between [Ca2+]i and recruitment has not been established yet, and the functional consequences of accelerated recruitment during synaptic activity have not been quantified experimentally. To probe the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of vesicle recruitment and to examine its functional role during trains of action potential (AP)-like stimuli, we monitored [Ca2+]i and synaptic responses simultaneously with paired recordings at the calyx of Held synapse. We found that a distinct, rapidly releasing vesicle pool is replenished with a rate that increases linearly with [Ca2+]i, without any apparent cooperativity. The slope factor for this increase is approximately 1 pool/(microM x s). Blocking Ca2+-dependent recruitment specifically with a calmodulin binding peptide revealed that the steady-state EPSCs during 100 Hz AP-like trains were maintained through this Ca2+-dependent recruitment mechanism. Using a simple model of vesicle dynamics, we estimated that the recruitment rate accelerated 10-fold during the steady-state compared with the rate at resting [Ca2+]i. We could also demonstrate an approximate sixfold increase in release probability (facilitation) during the initial 5-15 AP-like stimuli of such trains in our experimental condition, regardless of EPSC depression.},

	Abstract = {In many cell types, receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from internal stores is followed by Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. The sustained entry of Ca2+ is thought to result partly from the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools. Most investigations have characterized Ca2+ influx indirectly by measuring Ca(2+)-activated currents or using Fura-2 quenching by Mn2+, which in some cells enters the cells by the same influx pathway. But only a few studies have investigated this Ca2+ entry pathway more directly. We have combined patch-clamp and Fura-2 measurements to monitor membrane currents in mast cells under conditions where intracellular Ca2+ stores were emptied by either inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, ionomycin, or excess of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. The depletion of Ca2+ pools by these independent mechanisms commonly induced activation of a sustained calcium inward current that was highly selective for Ca2+ ions over Ba2+, Sr2+ and Mn2+. This Ca2+ current, which we term ICRAC (calcium release-activated calcium), is not voltage-activated and shows a characteristic inward rectification. It may be the mechanism by which electrically nonexcitable cells maintain raised intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and replenish their empty Ca2+ stores after receptor stimulation.},

	Abstract = {The superfamily of seven-transmembrane-domain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is the largest and most diverse group of transmembrane proteins involved in signal transduction. Each of the approximately 1000 family members found in vertebrates responds to stimuli as diverse as hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants and light, which selectively activate intracellular signaling events mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins. Because GPCRs are centrally positioned in the plasma membrane to initiate a cascade of cellular responses by diverse extracellular mediators, it is not surprising that modulation of GPCR function has been successful in the development of many marketed therapeutic agents. It has become clear that GPCRs for which a natural activating ligand has not yet been identified (orphan GPCRs) might provide a path to discovering new cellular substances that are important in human physiology. The process of 'de-orphanizing' these novel proteins has accelerated significantly and opened up new avenues for research in human physiology and pharmacology.},

	Abstract = {Highly enriched in brain tissue and present throughout the body, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is central to the coordination and execution of Ca(2+) signal transduction. The substrates phosphorylated by CaMKII are implicated in homeostatic regulation of the cell, as well as in activity-dependent changes in neuronal function that appear to underlie complex cognitive and behavioral responses, including learning and memory. The architecture of CaMKII holoenzymes is unique in nature. The kinase functional domains (12 per holoenzyme) are attached by stalklike appendages to a gear-shaped core, grouped into two clusters of six. Each subunit contains a catalytic, an autoregulatory, and an association domain. Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM) binding disinhibits the autoregulatory domain, allowing autophosphorylation and complex changes in the enzyme's sensitivity to Ca(2+)/CaM, including the generation of Ca(2+)/CaM-independent activity, CaM trapping, and CaM capping. These processes confer a type of molecular memory to the autoregulation and activity of CaMKII. Its function is intimately shaped by its multimeric structure, autoregulation, isozymic type, and subcellular localization; these features and processes are discussed as they relate to known and potential cellular functions of this multifunctional protein kinase.},

	Abstract = {Single channel models of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) channels such as the 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and ryanodine receptor often assume that Ca(2+)-dependent transitions are mediated by constant background cytosolic [Ca(2+)]. This assumption neglects the fact that Ca(2+) released by open channels may influence subsequent gating through the processes of Ca(2+)-activation or inactivation. Similarly, the influence of the dynamics of luminal depletion on the stochastic gating of intracellular Ca(2+) channels is often neglected, in spite of the fact that the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum [Ca(2+)] near the luminal face of intracellular Ca(2+) channels influences the driving force for Ca(2+), the rate of Ca(2+) release, and the magnitude and time course of the consequent increase in cytosolic domain [Ca(2+)]. Here we analyze how the steady-state open probability of several minimal Ca(2+)-regulated Ca(2+) channel models depends on the conductance of the channel and the time constants for the relaxation of elevated cytosolic [Ca(2+)] and depleted luminal [Ca(2+)] to the bulk [Ca(2+)] of both compartments. Our approach includes Monte Carlo simulation as well as numerical solution of a system of advection-reaction equations for the multivariate probability density of elevated cytosolic [Ca(2+)] and depleted luminal [Ca(2+)] conditioned on each state of the stochastically gating channel. Both methods are subsequently used to study the role of luminal depletion in the dynamics of Ca(2+) puff/spark termination in release sites composed of Ca(2+) channels that are activated, but not inactivated, by cytosolic Ca(2+). The probability density approach shows that such minimal Ca(2+) release site models may exhibit puff/spark-like dynamics in either of two distinct parameter regimes. In one case, puffs/spark termination is due to the process of stochastic attrition and facilitated by rapid Ca(2+) domain collapse [cf. DeRemigio, H., Smith, G., 2005. The dynamics of stochastic attrition viewed as an absorption time on a terminating Markov chain. Cell Calcium 38, 73-86]. In the second case, puff/spark termination is promoted by the local depletion of luminal Ca(2+).},

	Abstract = {The inhibitory GABAergic projection of thalamic nucleus reticularis (nRt) neurons onto thalamocortical relay cells (TCs) is important in generating the normal thalamocortical rhythmicity of slow wave sleep, and may be a key element in the production of abnormal rhythms associated with absence epilepsy. Both TCs and nRt cells can generate prominent Ca(2+)-dependent low-threshold spikes, which evoke bursts of Na(+)-dependent fast spikes, and are influential in rhythm generation. Substantial differences in the pattern of burst firing in TCs versus nRt neurons led us to hypothesize that there are distinct forms of transient Ca2+ current (I(T)) underlying burst discharges in these two cell types. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we analyzed I(T) in acutely isolated TCs and nRt neurons and found three key differences in biophysical properties. (1) The transient Ca2+ current in nRt neurons inactivated much more slowly than I(T) in TCs. This slow current is thus termed I(Ts). (2) The rate of inactivation for I(Ts) was nearly voltage independent. (3) Whole-cell I(Ts) amplitude was increased when Ba2+ was substituted for Ca2+ as the charge carrier. In addition, activation kinetics were slower for I(Ts) and the activation range was depolarized compared to that for I(T). Other properties of I(Ts) and I(T) were similar, including steady-state inactivation and sensitivities to blockade by divalent cations, amiloride, and antiepileptic drugs. Our findings demonstrate that subtypes of transient Ca2+ current are present in two different classes of thalamic neurons. The properties of I(Ts) lead to generation of long-duration calcium-dependent spike bursts in nRt cells. The resultant prolonged periods of GABA release onto TCs would play a critical role in maintaining rhythmicity by inducing TC hyperpolarization and promoting generation of low-threshold calcium spikes within relay nuclei.},

In many cell types, an increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration starts locally, propagates within the cell (Ca(2+) wave) and makes oscillatory changes (Ca(2+) oscillation). Studies of the intracellular Ca(2+) release mechanism from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) showed that the Ca(2+) release mechanism has inherent regenerative properties, which is essential for the generation of Ca(2+) waves and oscillations. Ca(2+) may shuttle between the ER and mitochondria, and this appears to be important for pacemaking of Ca(2+) oscillations. Importantly, Ca(2+) oscillations are an efficient mechanism in regulating cell functions, having effects supra-proportional to the sum of duration of Ca(2+) increase. Furthermore, Ca(2+) signaling mechanism studies have led to the development of a method for specific inhibition of Ca(2+) signaling, which has been used to identify hitherto unrecognized functions of Ca(2+) signals.},

Despite the physiological importance of this Ca(2+)-sensitive inactivation, its molecular mechanism is understood only in broad outline. We now demonstrate that Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation transpires by a Ca(2+)-induced shift of channel gating to a low open probability mode, distinguished by a more than 100-fold reduction of entry rate to the open state. A gating mechanism that explains this shift quantitatively and enables successful separation of Ca(2+)- and voltage-sensitive forms of inactivation is deduced and tested. Finally, both calmodulin activation and channel (de)phosphorylation are excluded as significant signaling events underlying Ca(2+)-induced mode shifts, leaving direct binding of Ca2+ to the channel as a likely chemical initiation event for inactivation.},

	Abstract = {The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptor (InsP(3)R) plays a critical role in generation of complex Ca(2+) signals in many cell types. In patch clamp recordings of isolated nuclei from insect Sf9 cells, InsP(3)R channels were consistently detected with regulation by cytoplasmic InsP(3) and free Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) very similar to that observed for vertebrate InsP(3)R. Long channel activity durations of the Sf9-InsP(3)R have now enabled identification of a novel aspect of InsP(3)R gating: modal gating. Using a novel algorithm to analyze channel modal gating kinetics, InsP(3)R gating can be separated into three distinct modes: a low activity mode, a fast kinetic mode, and a burst mode with channel open probability (P(o)) within each mode of 0.007 +/- 0.002, 0.24 +/- 0.03, and 0.85 +/- 0.02, respectively. Channels reside in each mode for long periods (tens of opening and closing events), and transitions between modes can be discerned with high resolution (within two channel opening and closing events). Remarkably, regulation of channel gating by [Ca(2+)](i) and [InsP(3)] does not substantially alter channel P(o) within a mode. Instead, [Ca(2+)](i) and [InsP(3)] affect overall channel P(o) primarily by changing the relative probability of the channel being in each mode, especially the high and low P(o) modes. This novel observation therefore reveals modal switching as the major mechanism of physiological regulation of InsP(3)R channel activity, with implications for the kinetics of Ca(2+) release events in cells.},

	Abstract = {We present a model that provides a unified framework for studying Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ waves in cardiac cells. The model is novel in combining 1) use of large currents (approximately 20 pA) through the Ca2+ release units (CRUs) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); 2) stochastic Ca2+ release (or firing) of CRUs; 3) discrete, asymmetric distribution of CRUs along the longitudinal (separation distance of 2 microm) and transverse (separated by 0.4-0.8 microm) directions of the cell; and 4) anisotropic diffusion of Ca2+ and fluorescent indicator to study the evolution of Ca2+ waves from Ca2+ sparks. The model mimics the important features of Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ waves in terms of the spontaneous spark rate, the Ca2+ wave velocity, and the pattern of wave propagation. Importantly, these features are reproduced when using experimentally measured values for the CRU Ca2+ sensitivity (approximately 15 microM). Stochastic control of CRU firing is important because it imposes constraints on the Ca2+ sensitivity of the CRU. Even with moderate (approximately 5 microM) Ca2+ sensitivity the very high spontaneous spark rate triggers numerous Ca2+ waves. In contrast, a single Ca2+ wave with arbitrarily large velocity can exist in a deterministic model when the CRU Ca2+ sensitivity is sufficiently high. The combination of low CRU Ca2+ sensitivity (approximately 15 microM), high cytosolic Ca2+ buffering capacity, and the spatial separation of CRUs help control the inherent instability of SR Ca2+ release. This allows Ca2+ waves to form and propagate given a sufficiently large initiation region, but prevents a single spark or a small group of sparks from triggering a wave.},

	Abstract = {Vasomotion is a rhythmic variation in microvascular diameter. Although known for more than 150 years, the cellular processes underlying the initiation of vasomotion are not fully understood. In the present study a model of a single cell is extended by coupling a number of cells into a tube. The simulated results point to a permissive role of cGMP in establishing intercellular synchronization. In sufficient concentration, cGMP may activate a cGMP-sensitive calcium-dependent chloride channel, causing a tight spatiotemporal coupling between release of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium, membrane depolarization, and influx of extracellular calcium. Low [cGMP] is associated only with unsynchronized waves. At intermediate concentrations, cells display either waves or whole cell oscillations, but these remain unsynchronized between cells. Whole cell oscillations are associated with rhythmic variation in membrane potential and flow of current through gap junctions. The amplitude of these oscillations in potential grows with increasing [cGMP], and, past a certain threshold, they become strong enough to entrain all cells in the vascular wall, thereby initiating sustained vasomotion. In this state there is a rhythmic flow of calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels into the cytoplasm, making the frequency of established vasomotion sensitive to membrane potential. It is concluded that electrical coupling through gap junctions is likely to be responsible for the rapid synchronization across a large number of cells. Gap-junctional current between cells is due to the appearance of oscillations in the membrane potential that again depends on the entrainment of sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane within the individual cell.},

	Abstract = {In vitro, alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation of rat mesenteric small arteries often leads to a rhythmic change in wall tension, i.e., vasomotion. Within the individual smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall, vasomotion is often preceded by a period of asynchronous calcium waves. Abruptly, these low-frequency waves may transform into high-frequency whole cell calcium oscillations. Simultaneously, multiple cells synchronize, leading to rhythmic generation of tension. We present a mathematical model of vascular smooth muscle cells that aims at characterizing this sudden transition. Simulations show calcium waves sweeping through the cytoplasm when the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is stimulated to release calcium. A rise in cGMP leads to the experimentally observed transition from waves to whole cell calcium oscillations. At the same time, membrane potential starts to oscillate and the frequency approximately doubles. In this transition, the simulated results point to a key role for a recently discovered cGMP-sensitive calcium-dependent chloride channel. This channel depolarizes the membrane in response to calcium released from the SR. In turn, depolarization causes a uniform opening of L-type calcium channels on the cell surface, stimulating a synchronized release of SR calcium and inducing the shift from waves to whole cell oscillations. The effect of the channel is therefore to couple the processes of the SR with those of the membrane. We hypothesize that the shift in oscillatory mode and the associated onset of oscillations in membrane potential within the individual cell may underlie sudden intercellular synchronization and the appearance of vasomotion.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the effects of Ca2+ diffusion, mobile and stationary Ca2+ buffers in the cytosol, and Ca2+ handling by the endoplasmic reticulum on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ wave propagation. Rapid equilibration of free and bound Ca2+ is used to describe Ca2+ sequestration by buffers in both the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Cytosolic Ca2+ regulation is based on a kinetic model of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor of De Young and Keizer that includes activation and inhibition of the IP3 receptor Ca2+ channel in the ER membrane and SERCA Ca2+ pumps in the ER. Diffusion of Ca2+ in the cytosol and the ER and the breakdown and diffusion of IP3 are also included in our calculations. Although Ca2+ diffusion is severely limited because of buffering, when conditions are chosen just below the threshold for Ca2+ oscillations, a pulse of IP3 or Ca2+ results in a solitary trigger wave that requires diffusion of Ca2+ for its propagation. In the oscillatory regime repetitive wave trains are observed, but for this type of wave neither the wave shape nor the speed is strongly dependent on the diffusion of Ca2+. Local phase differences lead to waves that are predominately kinematic in nature, so that the wave speed (c) is related to the wavelength (lambda) and the period of the oscillations (tau) approximately by the formula c = lambda/tau. The period is determined by features that control the oscillations, including [IP3] and pump activity, which are related to recent experiments. Both solitary waves and wave trains are accompanied by a Ca2+ depletion wave in the ER lumen, similar to that observed in cortical preparations from sea urchin eggs. We explore the effect of endogenous and exogenous Ca2+ buffers on wave speed and wave shape, which can be explained in terms of three distinct effects of buffering, and show that exogenous buffers or Ca2+ dyes can have considerable influence on the amplitude and width of the waves.},

	Abstract = {We construct a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ regulation in the ventricular myocyte that includes novel descriptions of subcellular mechanisms based on recent experimental findings: 1) the Keizer-Levine model for the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which displays adaptation at elevated Ca2+; 2) a model for the L-type Ca2+ channel that inactivates by mode switching; and 3) a restricted subspace into which the RyRs and L-type Ca2+ channels empty and interact via Ca2+. We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II ventricular cell model to our description of Ca2+ handling to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and Ca2+ regulation. The model can simulate Ca2+ transients during an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace [Ca2+] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30 microM) than the bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ (peak [Ca2+]i approximately 1 microM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic Ca2+, we use [Ca2+]i in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation. The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR Ca2+ loading. This model, therefore, shows improved behavior over existing models that lack detailed descriptions of subcellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Local intracellular Ca(2+) transients, termed Ca(2+) sparks, are caused by the coordinated opening of a cluster of ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of smooth muscle cells. Ca(2+) sparks are activated by Ca(2+) entry through dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, although the precise mechanisms of communication of Ca(2+) entry to Ca(2+) spark activation are not clear in smooth muscle. Ca(2+) sparks act as a positive-feedback element to increase smooth muscle contractility, directly by contributing to the global cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]) and indirectly by increasing Ca(2+) entry through membrane potential depolarization, caused by activation of Ca(2+) spark-activated Cl(-) channels. Ca(2+) sparks also have a profound negative-feedback effect on contractility by decreasing Ca(2+) entry through membrane potential hyperpolarization, caused by activation of large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels. In this review, the roles of Ca(2+) sparks in positive- and negative-feedback regulation of smooth muscle function are explored. We also propose that frequency and amplitude modulation of Ca(2+) sparks by contractile and relaxant agents is an important mechanism to regulate smooth muscle function.},

	Abstract = {The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons exhibit a unique pattern of episodic activity to control fertility in all mammals. To enable the measurement of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in adult GnRH neurons in situ, we generated transgenic mice in which the genetically encodable calcium indicator ratiometric Pericam was expressed by approximately 95% of GnRH neurons. Real-time monitoring of [Ca2+]i within adult male GnRH neurons in the acute brain slice revealed that approximately 70% of GnRH neurons exhibited spontaneous, 10-15 s duration [Ca2+]i transients with a mean frequency of 7 per hour. The remaining 30% of GnRH neurons did not exhibit calcium transients nor did a population of non-GnRH cells located within the lateral septum that express Pericam. Pharmacological studies using antagonists to the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) and several calcium channels, demonstrated that [Ca2+]i transients in GnRH neurons were generated by an InsP3R-dependent store-release mechanism and were independent of plasma membrane ligand- or voltage-gated calcium channels. Interestingly, the abolition of action potential-mediated transmission with tetrodotoxin reduced the number of [Ca2+]i transients in GnRH neurons by 50% (p &lt; 0.05), suggesting a modulatory role for synaptic inputs on [Ca2+]i transient frequency. Using a novel transgenic strategy that enables [Ca2+]i to be examined in a specific neuronal phenotype in situ, we provide evidence for spontaneous [Ca2+]i fluctuations in adult GnRH neurons. This represents the initial description of spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients in mature neurons and shows that they arise from an InsP3R-generating mechanism that is further modulated by synaptic inputs.},

	Abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors initiate signaling cascades. M(1) muscarinic receptor (M(1)R) activation couples through Galpha(q) to stimulate phospholipase C (PLC), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Depletion of PIP(2) closes PIP(2)-requiring Kv7.2/7.3 potassium channels (M current), thereby increasing neuronal excitability. This modulation of M current is relatively slow (6.4 s to reach within 1/e of the steady-state value). To identify the rate-limiting steps, we investigated the kinetics of each step using pairwise optical interactions likely to represent fluorescence resonance energy transfer for M(1)R activation, M(1)R/Gbeta interaction, Galpha(q)/Gbeta separation, Galpha(q)/PLC interaction, and PIP(2) hydrolysis. Electrophysiology was used to monitor channel closure. Time constants for M(1)R activation (<100 ms) and M(1)R/Gbeta interaction (200 ms) are both fast, suggesting that neither of them is rate limiting during muscarinic suppression of M current. Galpha(q)/Gbeta separation and Galpha(q)/PLC interaction have intermediate 1/e times (2.9 and 1.7 s, respectively), and PIP(2) hydrolysis (6.7 s) occurs on the timescale of M current suppression. Overexpression of PLC accelerates the rate of M current suppression threefold (to 2.0 s) to become nearly contemporaneous with Galpha(q)/PLC interaction. Evidently, channel release of PIP(2) and closure are rapid, and the availability of active PLC limits the rate of M current suppression.},

Ectopic overexpression of SERCA1a results in remodeling of the cardiac SR containing 80% SERCA1a and 20% endogenous SERCA2a with an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the total amount of SERCA protein (E. Loukianov et al. Circ. Res. 83: 889-897, 1998). We have analyzed the Ca2+ transport properties of membranes from SERCA1a TG hearts in comparison to control hearts. Our data show that the maximal velocity of SR Ca2+ transport was significantly increased ( approximately 1.9-fold) in TG hearts, whereas the apparent affinity of the SERCA pump for Ca2+ was not changed. Addition of phospholamban antibody in the Ca2+ uptake assays increased the apparent affinity for Ca2+ to the same extent in TG and non-TG (NTG) hearts, suggesting that phospholamban regulates the SERCA1a pump in TG hearts. Analysis of SERCA enzymatic properties in TG hearts revealed that the SERCA pump affinity for ATP, the Hill coefficient, the pH dependence of Ca2+ uptake, and the effect of acidic pH on Ca2+ transport were similar to those of NTG hearts. Interestingly, the rate constant of phosphoenzyme decay (turnover rate of SERCA enzyme) was also very similar between TG and NTG hearts. Together these findings suggest that 1) the SERCA1a pump can functionally substitute for SERCA2a and is regulated by endogenous phospholamban in the heart and 2) SERCA1a exhibits several enzymatic properties similar to those of SERCA2a when expressed in a cardiac setting.},

	Abstract = {In Xenopus oocytes, as well as other cells, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-induced Ca2+ release is an excitable process that generates propagating Ca2+ waves that annihilate upon collision. The fundamental property responsible for excitability appears to be the Ca2+ dependency of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Here we report that Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ wave activity is strengthened by oxidizable substrates that energize mitochondria, increasing Ca2+ wave amplitude, velocity and interwave period. The effects of pyruvate/malate are blocked by ruthenium red at the Ca2+ uniporter, by rotenone at complex I, and by antimycin A at complex III, and are subsequently rescued at complex IV by ascorbate tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD). Our data reveal that potential-driven mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is a major factor in the regulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release and clearly demonstrate a physiological role of mitochondria in intracellular Ca2+ signalling.},

In previous single channel studies, the Ca dependence of channel activity, monitored at 2 microM InsP3, was described by a bell-shaped curve (Bezprozvanny, I., J. Watras, and B.E. Ehrlich. 1991. Nature (Lond.). 351:751-754). We report here that, when we used lower InsP3 concentrations, the peak of the Ca-dependence curve shifted to lower Ca concentrations. Unexpectedly, when we used high InsP3 concentrations, channel activity persisted at Ca concentrations as high as 30 microM. To explore this unexpected response of the channel, we measured InsP3 binding over a broad range of InsP3 concentrations. We found the well-characterized high affinity InsP3 binding sites (with Kd < 1 and 50 nM) (Maeda, N., M. Niinobe, and K. Mikoshiba. 1990. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 9:61-67; Mignery, G., T.C.

Nature (Lond.). 339:468-470) and a low affinity InsP3 binding site (Kd = 10 microM). Using these InsP3 binding sites, we developed a new model that accounts for the shift in the Ca-dependence curve at low InsP3 levels and the maintained channel activity at high Ca and InsP3 levels. The observed Ca dependence of the InsP3-gated Ca channel allows the cell to abbreviate the rise of intracellular Ca in the presence of low levels of InsP3, but also provides a means of maintaining high intracellular Ca during periods of prolonged stimulation.},

	Abstract = {At many synapses, the amount of transmitter released by action potentials increases progressively during a train of spikes. This enhancement of evoked transmitter release grows during tetanic stimulation with several time constants, each bearing a different name (facilitation: tens to hundreds of milliseconds; augmentation: several seconds; potentiation: several minutes), and the enhancement of release to test spikes after a tetanus decays with similar time constants. All these processes depend on presynaptic Ca2+ influx during the conditioning tetanus. It has often been proposed that these forms of synaptic plasticity are due to residual Ca2+ present in nerve terminals following conditioning activity. We tested this idea directly by using photolabile Ca2+ chelators to reduce residual Ca2+ following conditioning stimulation or to generate an artificial elevation in Ca2+ concentration, and observed the effects on synaptic transmission at crayfish neuromuscular junctions. We found that facilitation, augmentation and potentiation are caused by the continuing action of residual Ca2+. Augmentation and potentiation seem to arise from Ca2+ acting at a separate site from facilitation, and these sites are different from the molecular target triggering neurosecretion.},

	Abstract = {The cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1; ref. 2) is a bi-directional Ca2+ transporter that contributes to the electrical activity of the heart. When, and if, Ca2+ is exported or imported depends on the Na+/Ca2+ exchange ratio. Whereas a ratio of 3:1 (Na+:Ca2+) has been indicated by Ca2+ flux equilibrium studies, a ratio closer to 4:1 has been indicated by exchange current reversal potentials. Here we show, using an ion-selective electrode technique to quantify ion fluxes in giant patches, that ion flux ratios are approximately 3.2 for maximal transport in either direction. With Na+ and Ca2+ on both sides of the membrane, net current and Ca2+ flux can reverse at different membrane potentials, and inward current can be generated in the absence of cytoplasmic Ca2+, but not Na+. We propose that NCX1 can transport not only 1 Ca2+ or 3 Na+ ions, but also 1 Ca2+ with 1 Na+ ion at a low rate. Therefore, in addition to the major 3:1 transport mode, import of 1 Na+ with 1 Ca2+ defines a Na+-conducting mode that exports 1 Ca2+, and an electroneutral Ca2+ influx mode that exports 3 Na+. The two minor transport modes can potentially determine resting free Ca2+ and background inward current in heart.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) was developed based on data mostly from rat mesenteric arterioles. The model focuses on (a) the plasma membrane electrophysiology; (b) Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); (c) cytosolic balance of Ca2+, Na+, K+, and Cl ions; and (d) IP3 and cGMP formation in response to norepinephrine(NE) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulation. Stimulation with NE induced membrane depolarization and an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transient followed by a plateau. The plateau concentrations were mostly determined by the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. NE causes a greater increase in [Ca2+]i than stimulation with KCl to equivalent depolarization. Model simulations suggest that the effect of[Na+]i accumulation on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can potentially account for this difference.Elevation of [Ca2+]i within a concentration window (150-300 nM) by NE or KCl initiated [Ca2+]i oscillations with a concentration-dependent period. The oscillations were generated by the nonlinear dynamics of Ca2+ release and refilling in the SR. NO repolarized the NE-stimulated SMC and restored low [Ca2+]i mainly through its effect on Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Under certain conditions, Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition can result in the elevation of [Na+]i and the reversal of NCX, increasing resting cytosolic and SR Ca2+ content, as well as reactivity to NE. Blockade of the NCX's reverse mode could eliminate these effects. We conclude that the integration of the selected cellular components yields a mathematical model that reproduces, satisfactorily, some of the established features of SMC physiology. Simulations suggest a potential role of intracellular Na+ in modulating Ca2+ dynamics and provide insights into the mechanisms of SMC constriction, relaxation, and the phenomenon of vasomotion. The model will provide the basis for the development of multi-cellular mathematical models that will investigate microcirculatory function in health and disease.},

@article{kapela2010,
	Abstract = {This study presents a multicellular computational model of a rat mesenteric arteriole to investigate the signal transduction mechanisms involved in the generation of conducted vasoreactivity. The model comprises detailed descriptions of endothelial (ECs) and smooth muscle (SM) cells (SMCs), coupled by nonselective gap junctions. With strong myoendothelial coupling, local agonist stimulation of the EC or SM layer causes local changes in membrane potential (V(m)) that are conducted electrotonically, primarily through the endothelium. When myoendothelial coupling is weak, signals initiated in the SM conduct poorly, but the sensitivity of the SMCs to current injection and agonist stimulation increases. Thus physiological transmembrane currents can induce different levels of local V(m) change, depending on cell's gap junction connectivity. The physiological relevance of current and voltage clamp stimulations in intact vessels is discussed. Focal agonist stimulation of the endothelium reduces cytosolic calcium (intracellular Ca(2+) concentration) in the prestimulated SM layer. This SMC Ca(2+) reduction is attributed to a spread of EC hyperpolarization via gap junctions. Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, but not Ca(2+), diffusion through homocellular gap junctions can increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in neighboring ECs. The small endothelial Ca(2+) spread can amplify the total current generated at the local site by the ECs and through the nitric oxide pathway, by the SMCs, and thus reduces the number of stimulated cells required to induce distant responses. The distance of the electrotonic and Ca(2+) spread depends on the magnitude of SM prestimulation and the number of SM layers. Model results are consistent with experimental data for vasoreactivity in rat mesenteric resistance arteries.},

	Abstract = {A kinetic model was proposed to simulate an isometric contraction curve in smooth muscle on the basis of the myosin phosphorylation hypothesis. The Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent activation of myosin light-chain kinase and the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction of myosin were mathematically treated. Solving the kinetic equations at a steady state, we could calculate the relationship between the Ca2+ concentration and the myosin phosphorylation. Assuming that two-head-phosphorylated myosin has an actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity and that this state corresponds to an active state, we computed the time courses of the myosin phosphorylation and the active state for various Ca2+ transients. The time course of the active state was converted into that of isometric tension by use of Sandow&apos;s model composed of a contractile element and a series elastic component. The model could simulate not only the isometric contraction curves for any given Ca2+ transient but also the following experimental results: the calmodulin-dependent shift of the Ca2+ sensitivity of isometric tension observed in skinned muscle fibers, the disagreement between the Ca2+ sensitivity of myosin phosphorylation and that of isometric tension at a steady state, and the disagreement between the time course of myosin phosphorylation and that of isometric tension development.},

Here we report that glutamate induces single-peaked intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in mGluR1alpha-transfected cells but elicits Ca2+ oscillations in mGluR5a-transfected cells. The response patterns of the intracellular Ca2+ increase depend upon the identity of a single amino acid, aspartate (at position 854) or threonine (at position 840), located within the G-protein-interacting domains of mGluR1alpha and mGluR5a, respectively. Pharmacological and peptide mapping analyses indicated that phosphorylation of the threonine residue at position 840 of mGluR5a by protein kinase C (PKC) is responsible for the generation of Ca2+ oscillations in mGluR5a-expressing cells. To our knowledge this is the first evidence that PKC phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors is important in producing oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ signalling.},

	Abstract = {We propose a mechanism for agonist-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations that involves two roles for cytosolic Ca2+: (a) inhibition of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) stimulated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and (b) stimulation of the production of IP3 through its action on phospholipase C (PLC), via a Gq protein related mechanism. Relying on quantitative experiments by Parker, I., and I. Ivorra (1990. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 87:260-264) on the inhibition of Ca2+ release from the ER using caged-IP3, we develop a kinetic model of inhibition that allows us to simulate closely their experiments. The model assumes that the ER IP3 receptor is a tetramer of independent subunits that can bind both Ca2+ and IP3. Upon incorporation of the action of Ca2+ on PLC that leads to production of IP3, we observe in-phase-oscillations of Ca2+ and IP3 at intermediate values of agonist stimulation. The oscillations occur on a time scale of 10-20 s, which is comparable to the time scale for inhibition in Xenopus oocytes. Analysis of the mechanism shows that Ca(2+)-inhibition of IP3-stimulated Ca2+ release from the ER is an essential step in the mechanism. We also find that the effect of Ca2+ on PLC can lead to an indirect increase of cytosolic Ca2+, superficially resembling "Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release." The mechanism that we propose appears to be consistent with recent experiments on REF52 cells by Harootunian, A. T., J. P. Y. Kao, S. Paranjape, and R. Y. Tsien. (1991. Science [Wash. DC]. 251:75-78.) and we propose additional experiments to help test its underlying assumptions.},

	Abstract = {A simplified mechanism that mimics "adaptation" of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) has been developed and its significance for Ca2+(-)induced Ca2+ release and Ca2+ oscillations investigated. For parameters that reproduce experimental data for the RyR from cardiac cells, adaptation of the RyR in combination with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase Ca2+ pumps in the internal stores can give rise to either low [Cai2+] steady states or Ca2+ oscillations coexisting with unphysiologically high [Cai2+] steady states. In this closed-cell-type model rapid, adaptation-dependent Ca2+ oscillations occur only in limited ranges of parameters. In the presence of Ca2+ influx and efflux from outside the cell (open-cell model) Ca2+ oscillations occur for a wide range of physiological parameter values and have a period that is determined by the rate of Ca2+ refilling of the stores. Although the rate of adaptation of the RyR has a role in determining the shape and the period of the Ca2+ spike, it is not essential for their existence. This is in marked contrast with what is observed for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor for which the biphasic activation and inhibition of its activity by Ca2+ are sufficient to produce oscillations. Results for this model are compared with those based on Ca2+(-)induced Ca2+ release alone in the bullfrog sympathetic neuron. This kinetic model should be suitable for analyzing phenomena associated with "Ca2+ sparks," including their merger into Ca2+ waves in cardiac myocytes.},

	Abstract = {Punctate releases of Ca2+, called Ca2+ sparks, originate at the regular array of t-tubules in cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle. During Ca2+ overload sparks serve as sites for the initiation and propagation of Ca2+ waves in myocytes. Computer simulations of spark-mediated waves are performed with model release sites that reproduce the adaptive Ca2+ release observed for the ryanodine receptor. The speed of these waves is proportional to the diffusion constant of Ca2+, D, rather than D, as is true for reaction-diffusion equations in a continuous excitable medium. A simplified "fire-diffuse-fire" model that mimics the properties of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from isolated sites is used to explain this saltatory mode of wave propagation. Saltatory and continuous wave propagation can be differentiated by the temperature and Ca2+ buffer dependence of wave speed.},

	Abstract = {Using a modular approach, in which kinetic models of various mechanisms of calcium handling in cells are fine-tuned to in vivo and in vitro measurements before combining them into whole-cell models, three distinct modes of transmission of calcium waves in mature and immature frog eggs have been defined. Two modes of transmission are found in immature eggs, where the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) controls release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The first mode corresponds to an excitable physiological state of the cytoplasm and results in solitary waves that can appear as circular or spiral waves in two dimensions with the wave speed proportional to the square root of the diffusion constant of calcium. A second mode occurs when the state of the cytoplasm is oscillatory and because of the small size of the buffered diffusion constant for calcium, the wave speed can appear to be weakly dependent on diffusion. In the mature frog egg, where the sperm-induced Ca2+ fertilization wave is a propagating front, the cytoplasm appears to be bistable and in this mode the wave speed is also proportional to the square root of the diffusion constant. Here we investigate a fourth mode of propagation for cardiac myocytes, in which calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is dominated by clusters of ryanodine receptors spaced at regular intervals. In myocytes a stochastically excitable myoplasm leads to the spontaneous production of calcium 'sparks' that under certain conditions can merge into saltatory waves with a speed proportional to the diffusion constant.},

	Abstract = {1. Cytosolic Ca2+ has been proposed to act as both a positive and a negative feedback signal on the inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor. However, it is unclear how this might affect the Ca2+ response in vivo. 2. Mouse pancreatic acinar cells were whole-cell patch clamped to record the Ca2+-dependent chloride (Cl(Ca)) current spikes and imaged to record the cytosolic Ca2+ spikes elicited by the injection of Ins(2,4,5)P3. Increasing concentrations of Ca2+ buffer (up to 200 microM EGTA or BAPTA) were associated with the appearance of steps in the current activation phase and a prevalence of smaller-amplitude Cl(Ca) spikes. Imaging experiments showed that with increased buffer the secretory pole cytosolic Ca2+ signal became fragmented and spatially discrete Ca2+ release events were observed. 3. At higher buffer concentrations (200-500 microM), increasing concentrations of EGTA increased spike frequency and reduced spike amplitude. In contrast, BAPTA decreased spike frequency and maintained large spike amplitudes. 4. We conclude that, during InsP3-evoked spiking, long-range Ca2+ feedback ( approximately 2-4 microm) shapes the rising phase of the Ca2+ signal by acting to co-ordinate discrete Ca2+ release events and short-range ( approximately 40 nm) Ca2+ feedback acts to inhibit further Ca2+ release.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes respond to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate with dynamic spatio-temporal changes in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i. Although they share a common wave-like appearance, the different [Ca2+]i changes--an initial spike, sustained elevation, oscillatory intracellular waves, and regenerative intercellular waves--are actually separate and distinct phenomena. These separate components of the astrocytic Ca2+ response appear to be generated by two different signal transduction pathways. The metabotropic response evokes an initial spatial Ca2+ spike that can propagate rapidly from cell to cell and appears to involve IP3. The metabotropic response can also produce oscillatory intracellular waves of various amplitudes and frequencies that propagate within cells and are sustained only in the presence of external Ca2+. The ionotropic response, however, evokes a sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i associated with receptor-mediated Na+ and Ca2+ influx, depolarization, and voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx. In addition, the ionotropic response can lead to regenerative intercellular waves that propagate smoothly and nondecrementally from cell to cell, possibly involving Na+/Ca2+ exchange. All these astrocytic [Ca2+]i changes tend to appear wave-like, traveling from region to region as a transient rise in [Ca2+]i. Nevertheless, as our understanding of the cellular events that underlie these [Ca2+]i changes grows, it becomes increasingly clear that glutamate-induced Ca2+ signaling is a composite of separate and distinct phenomena, which may be distinguished not based on appearance alone, but rather on their underlying mechanisms.},

@article{kim2005,
	Abstract = {The activation of Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR5 and mGluR1alpha, triggers intracellular calcium release; however, mGluR5 activation is unique in that it elicits Ca2+ oscillations. A short region of the mGluR5 C terminus is the critical determinant and differs from the analogous region of mGluR1alpha by a single amino acid residue, Thr-840, which is an aspartic acid (Asp-854) in mGluR1alpha. Previous studies show that mGluR5-elicited Ca2+ oscillations require protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation and identify Thr-840 as the phosphorylation site. However, direct phosphorylation of mGluR5 has not been studied in detail. We have used biochemical analyses to directly investigate the phosphorylation of the mGluR5 C terminus. We showed that Ser-839 on mGluR5 is directly phosphorylated by PKC, whereas Thr-840 plays a permissive role. Although Ser-839 is conserved in mGluR1alpha (Ser-853), it is not phosphorylated, as the adjacent residue (Asp-854) is not permissive; however, mutagenesis of Asp-854 to a permissive alanine residue allows phosphorylation of Ser-853 on mGluR1alpha. We investigated the physiological consequences of mGluR5 Ser-839 phosphorylation using Ca2+ imaging. Mutations that eliminate Ser-839 phosphorylation prevent the characteristic mGluR5-dependent Ca2+ oscillations. However, mutation of Thr-840 to alanine, which prevents potential Thr-840 phosphorylation but is still permissive for Ser-839 phosphorylation, has no effect on Ca2+ oscillations. Thus, we showed that it is phosphorylation of Ser-839, not Thr-840, that is absolutely required for the unique Ca2+ oscillations produced by mGluR5 activation. The Thr-840 residue is important only in that it is permissive for the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-839.},

	Abstract = {Secretion of catecholamines from neuroendocrine cells is relatively slow and it is likely that redistribution and buffering of Ca2+ is a major factor for delaying the response after a stimulus. In fact, in a recent study (Chow, R. H., J. Klingauf, and E. Neher. 1994. Time course of Ca2+ concentration triggering exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91:12765-12769) Chow et al. concluded that the concentration of free calcium ([Ca2+]i) at a release site peaks at  10 microM during short-step depolarizations, and then decays to baseline over tens of milliseconds. To check whether such a time course is consistent with diffusion theory, we modeled buffered diffusion in the vicinity of a Ca2+ channel pore. Peak [Ca2+]i and the slow decay were well simulated when release-ready granules were randomly distributed within a regular grid of Ca2+ channels with mean interchannel distances of 300-600 nm. For such large spacings, however, the initial rise in [Ca2+]i was underestimated, suggesting that a small fraction of the release-ready pool (approximately 10%) experiences much higher [Ca2+]i, and thus might be colocalized with Ca2+ channels. A model that accommodates these findings then correctly predicts many recent observations, including the result that single action potentials evoke near-synchronous transmitter release with low quantal yield, whereas trains of action potentials lead to desynchronized release, but with severalfold increased quantal yield. The simulations emphasize the role of Ca2+ not only in triggering, but also in modulating the secretory response: buffers are locally depleted by residual Ca2+ of a preceding stimulus, so that a second pulse leads to a larger peak [Ca2+]i at the fusion sites.},

With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffusion does not play an important role to achieve synchronization. Our model is validated by published in vitro experiments obtained on rat mesenteric arterial segments.},

	Abstract = {Asynchronous and synchronous calcium oscillations occur in a variety of cells. A well-established pathway for intercellular communication is provided by gap junctions which connect adjacent cells and can mediate electrical and chemical coupling. Several experimental studies report that cells presenting only a transient increase when freshly dispersed may oscillate when they are coupled. Such observations suggest that the role of gap junctions is not only to coordinate calcium oscillations of adjacent cells. Gap junctions may also be important to generate oscillations. Here we illustrate the emergent properties of electrically coupled smooth muscle cells using a model that we recently proposed. A bifurcation analysis in the case of two cells reveals that synchronous and asynchronous calcium oscillations can be induced by electrical coupling. In a larger population of smooth muscle cells, electrical coupling may result in the creation of groups of cells presenting synchronous calcium oscillations. The elements of one group may be distant from each other. Moreover, our results highlight a general mechanism by which gap junctional electrical coupling can give rise to out of phase calcium oscillations in smooth muscle cells that are non-oscillating when uncoupled. All these observations remain true in the case of non-identical cells, except that the solution corresponding to synchronous calcium oscillations disappears and that the formation of groups is sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {Smooth muscle and endothelial cells in the arterial wall are exposed to mechanical stress. Indeed blood flow induces intraluminal pressure variations and shear stress. An increase in pressure may induce a vessel contraction, a phenomenon known as the myogenic response. Many muscular vessels present vasomotion, i.e., rhythmic diameter oscillations caused by synchronous cytosolic calcium oscillations of the smooth muscle cells. Vasomotion has been shown to be modulated by pressure changes. To get a better understanding of the effect of stress and in particular pressure on vasomotion, we propose a model of a blood vessel describing the calcium dynamics in a coupled population of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells and the consequent vessel diameter variations. We show that a rise in pressure increases the calcium concentration. This may either induce or abolish vasomotion, or increase its frequency depending on the initial conditions. In our model the myogenic response is less pronounced for large arteries than for small arteries and occurs at higher values of pressure if the wall thickness is increased. Our results are in agreement with experimental observations concerning a broad range of vessels.},

	Abstract = {In vitro, different techniques are used to study the smooth muscle cells' calcium dynamics and contraction/relaxation mechanisms on arteries. Most experimental studies use either an isometric or an isobaric setup. However, in vivo, a blood vessel is neither isobaric nor isometric nor isotonic, as it is continuously submitted to intraluminal pressure variations arising from heart beat. We use a theoretical model of the smooth muscle calcium and arterial radius dynamics to determine whether results may be considerably different depending on the experimental conditions (isometric, isobaric, isotonic, or cyclic pressure variations). We show that isobaric conditions appear to be more realistic than isometric or isotonic situations, as the calcium dynamics is similar under cyclic intraluminal pressure variations (in vivo-like situation) and under a constant pressure (isobaric situation). The arterial contraction is less pronounced in isotonic than in isobaric conditions, and the vasoconstrictor sensitivity higher in isometric than isobaric or isotonic conditions, in agreement with experimental observations. Interestingly, the model predicts that isometric conditions may generate artifacts like the coexistence of multiple stable states. We have verified this model prediction experimentally using rat mesenteric arteries mounted on a wire myograph and stimulated with phenylephrine.},

	Abstract = {In rat mesenteric arteries, smooth muscle cells exhibit intercellular calcium waves in response to local phenylephrine stimulation. These waves have a velocity of approximately 20 cells/s and a range of approximately 80 cells. We analyze these waves in a theoretical model of a population of coupled smooth muscle cells, based on the hypothesis that the wave results from cell membrane depolarization propagation. We study the underlying mechanisms and highlight the importance of voltage-operated channels, calcium-induced calcium release, and chloride channels. Our model is in agreement with experimental observations, and we demonstrate that calcium waves presenting a velocity of approximately 20 cells/s can be mediated by electrical coupling. The wave velocity is limited by the time needed for calcium influx through voltage-operated calcium channels and the subsequent calcium-induced calcium release, and not by the speed of the depolarization spreading. The waves are partially regenerated, but have a spatial limit in propagation. Moreover, the model predicts that a refractory period of calcium signaling may significantly affect the wave appearance.},

	Abstract = {Graded or "quantal" Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores has been observed in various cell types following activation of either ryanodine receptors (RyR) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)R). The mechanism causing the release of Ca(2+) stores in direct proportion to the strength of stimulation is unresolved. We investigated the properties of quantal Ca(2+) release evoked by activation of RyR in PC12 cells, and in particular whether the sensitivity of RyR to the agonist caffeine was altered by lumenal Ca(2+). Quantal Ca(2+) release was observed in cells stimulated with 1 to 40 mM caffeine, a range of caffeine concentrations giving a >10-fold change in lumenal Ca(2+) content. The Ca(2+) load of the caffeine-sensitive stores was modulated by allowing them to refill for varying times after complete discharge with maximal caffeine, or by depolarizing the cells with K(+) to enhance their normal steady-state loading. The threshold for RyR activation was sensitized approximately 10-fold as the Ca(2+) load increased from a minimal to a maximal loading. In addition, the fraction of Ca(2+) released by low caffeine concentrations increased. Our data suggest that RyR are sensitive to lumenal Ca(2+) over the full range of Ca(2+) loads that can be achieved in an intact PC12 cell, and that changes in RyR sensitivity may be responsible for the termination of Ca(2+) release underlying the quantal effect.},

Approximately 30% of the pinealocytes exhibited spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations whose frequency differed from cell to cell. Neither illumination with bright light nor dark adaptation of the cells had an apparent effect on the oscillations. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or application of 10 microM nifedipine caused a reversible breakdown of the [Ca2+]i oscillations. Application of 60 mM KCl elevated [Ca2+]i in 90% of the oscillating and 50% of the non-oscillating pinealocytes. The effect of KCl was blocked by 50 microM nifedipine. These results suggest that voltage-gated L-type calcium channels play a major role in the regulation of [Ca2+]i in trout pinealocytes. Experiments with thapsigargin (2 microM) revealed the presence of intracellular calcium stores in 80% of the trout pinealocytes, but their role for regulation of [Ca2+]i remains elusive. Treatment with norepinephrine (100 pM-50 microM), previously shown to induce calcium release from intracellular calcium stores in rat pinealocytes, had no apparent effect on [Ca2+]i in any trout pinealocyte. This finding conforms to the concept that noradrenergic mechanisms are not involved in signal transduction in the directly light-sensitive pineal organ of anamniotic vertebrates.},

Perifused primary cultures of rat hypothalamic neurons, as well as the GT1-1 GnRH neuronal cell line, spontaneously exhibited episodic GnRH secretion of comparable frequency to that observed with perifused hypothalami. Such pulsatile GnRH release from GT1 cells indicates that GnRH neurons generate rhythmic secretory activity in the absence of input from other cell types. In primary hypothalamic cultures, the frequency of GnRH pulses increased with the duration of culture. The spontaneous pulsatility in GnRH release was abolished in Ca(2+)-deficient medium and was markedly attenuated in the presence of nifedipine, an antagonist of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The basal intracellular Ca2+ level of perifused GT1-1 cells cultured on coverslips was also dose-dependently reduced by nifedipine. Conversely, depolarization with high K+ increased intracellular Ca2+ and GnRH release in an extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent and nifedipine-sensitive manner. The dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644 increased basal and K(+)-induced elevations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and GnRH secretion. These findings demonstrate that pulsatile neuropeptide secretion is an intrinsic property of GnRH neuronal networks and is dependent on voltage-sensitive Ca2+ influx for its maintenance.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is known to play a key role during induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Given the dependence of LTP on the frequency of synaptic activation, several previous modeling efforts have proposed that biochemical properties of CaMKII itself might be in part responsible for this dependence. Recently, De Koninck and Schulman (1998) have provided direct experimental evidence that the enzyme itself is sensitive to the frequency of Ca(2+) activation. Here we demonstrate the ability of a detailed biophysical model constructed solely on enzyme kinetics of purified proteins to generate the frequency sensitivity demonstrated by De Koninck and Schulman. Quantitative analysis of the model reveals that this frequency sensitivity is provided by a mechanism different from those previously postulated. This analysis leads to specific predictions concerning the effects of mutations on this process. We further employ the model to examine the asymptotic behavior of CaMKII-phosphatase system during longer simulated periods of stimulation. The analyses of the model suggest that the transient and asymptotic frequency sensitivity of this enzyme are dependent on different biochemical mechanisms. These results may be applicable to Ca(2+)/calmodulin signaling pathways in general.},

	Abstract = {The influence of membrane potential (Vm) on cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i) oscillations during the sustained extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent phase of the Ca2+ signaling response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was analyzed in cultured pituitary gonadotrophs. In agonist- and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-stimulated cells, sustained [Ca2+]i oscillations were extinguished by hyperpolarization after 3-15 min despite the availability of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium. Single depolarizing pulses transiently restored the amplitude of the sustained spiking in a dihydropyridine- and extracellular Ca(2+)-sensitive manner. The responses to depolarization showed a marked dependence on Vm that was correlated with the steady-state inward Ca2+ current. In addition, repetitive application of brief depolarizing pulses modulated the frequency of agonist- and Ins(1,4,5)P3-controlled spiking; depolarization pulses at frequencies lower than the intrinsic rate of episodic Ca2+ release triggered large transients between the autonomous spikes, whereas higher frequencies of depolarizing pulses overcame the original Ca2+ spiking frequency. These extrinsically driven and extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent oscillations were sensitive to the Ca(2+)-ATPase blocker, thapsigargin, but not to ryanodine. On the other hand, spontaneous firing and application of depolarizing pulses to nonstimulated cells failed to induce thapsigargin-sensitive oscillations. These findings demonstrate that the pattern of Ca2+ signaling in gonadotrophs does not depend exclusively on the Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration, but also on the excitable status of the cell. Such modulation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-controlled Ca2+ signaling system by changes in Vm could provide a mechanism for the integration of multiple inputs that utilize diverse signal transduction pathways.},

	Abstract = {Traditionally, astrocytes have been considered to couple via gap-junctions into a syncytium with only rudimentary spatial organization. However, this view is challenged by growing experimental evidence that astrocytes organize as a proper gap-junction mediated network with more complex region-dependent properties. On the other hand, the propagation range of intercellular calcium waves (ICW) within astrocyte populations is as well highly variable, depending on the brain region considered. This suggests that the variability of the topology of gap-junction couplings could play a role in the variability of the ICW propagation range. Since this hypothesis is very difficult to investigate with current experimental approaches, we explore it here using a biophysically realistic model of three-dimensional astrocyte networks in which we varied the topology of the astrocyte network, while keeping intracellular properties and spatial cell distribution and density constant. Computer simulations of the model suggest that changing the topology of the network is indeed sufficient to reproduce the distinct ranges of ICW propagation reported experimentally. Unexpectedly, our simulations also predict that sparse connectivity and restriction of gap-junction couplings to short distances should favor propagation while long-distance or dense connectivity should impair it. Altogether, our results provide support to recent experimental findings that point toward a significant functional role of the organization of gap-junction couplings into proper astroglial networks. Dynamic control of this topology by neurons and signaling molecules could thus constitute a new type of regulation of neuron-glia and glia-glia interactions.},

	Abstract = {We model the space between the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (JSR) membrane and the inner leaflet of the transverse tubular ("T") sarcolemmal (SL) membrane, the diadic cleft, with respect to calcium (Ca) concentration and movement. The model predicts the following: 1) Ca influx via the "L" channel increases [Ca] to 1 microM within a distance of 50 nm from the channel mouth in < 500 microseconds. This is sufficient to trigger Ca release from a domain of 9 "feet." 2) By contrast, "reverse" Na/Ca exchange will increase [Ca] to approximately 0.5 microM throughout the cleft space in 10 ms, sufficient to trigger Ca release, but clearly to a lesser extent and more slowly than the channel. 3) After a 20-ms JSR release into the cleft via the "feet" [Ca] peaks at 600 microM (cleft center) to 100 microM (cleft periphery) and then declines to diastolic level (100 nM) within 150 ms throughout the cleft. 4) The ratio of flux out of the cleft via Na/Ca exchange to flux out of the cleft to the cytosol varies inversely as JSR Ca release. 5) Removal of SL anionic Ca-binding sites from the model will cause [Ca] to fall to 100 nM throughout the cleft in < 1 ms after JSR release ceases. This markedly reduces Na/Ca exchange. 6) Removal from or decreased concentration of Na/Ca exchangers in the cleft will cause [Ca] to fall too slowly after JSR release to permit triggered release upon subsequent excitation.},

	Abstract = {In salivary acinar cells, the pattern of the Ca2+ signals that regulates fluid and enzyme secretion has yet to be resolved, as there are conflicting reports in the literature. We have used a two-photon technique to directly visualize the acinar cell lumen in living fragments of exocrine tissue and simultaneously recorded agonist-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+. We show near-synchronous global Ca2+ responses in submandibular acinar cells, distinct from the typical apical to basal Ca2+ wave usually seen in rodent pancreatic acinar cells. In an effort to explain the basis of these near-synchronous global Ca2+ responses we used immunocytochemical experiments to localize luminal proteins and inositol trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) in tissue fragments. Zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), a tight junction protein, shows that individual submandibular acinar cells are often nearly completely encircled by a narrow luminal structure. By contrast, in pancreatic fragments, ZO-1 staining shows short luminal branches terminating abruptly at the apical pole of single acinar cells. Co-immunostaining of InsP3Rs type 2 and type 3 showed them in the same region as ZO-1 in both exocrine tissues. Functional experiments showed that the near-synchronous global Ca2+ responses were still observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and also in the presence of ryanodine. We conclude that the elaborate luminal region of submandibular cells leads to a hitherto unrecognized extensive distribution of InsP3Rs in a band around the cell and that this underlies the near-synchronous global Ca2+ response to agonists. We suggest that this may be a structural adaptation in submandibular cells to support the copious amounts of fluid secreted.},

	Abstract = {Many different agonists use calcium as a second messenger. Despite intensive research in intracellular calcium signalling it is an unsolved riddle how the different types of information represented by the different agonists, is encoded using the universal carrier calcium. It is also still not clear how the information encoded is decoded again into the intracellular specific information at the site of enzymes and genes. After the discovery of calcium oscillations, one likely mechanism is that information is encoded in the frequency, amplitude and waveform of the oscillations. This hypothesis has received some experimental support. However, the mechanism of decoding of oscillatory signals is still not known. Here, we study a mechanistic model of calcium oscillations, which is able to reproduce both spiking and bursting calcium oscillations. We use the model to study the decoding of calcium signals on the basis of co-operativity of calcium binding to various proteins. We show that this co-operativity offers a simple way to decode different calcium dynamics into different enzyme activities.},

	Abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides correlates with aging and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ peptides, which cause early synaptic dysfunctions, spine loss, and memory deficits, also disturb intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. By cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) measurements, we here define the short-term effects of synthetic Aβ42 on neuronal Ca(2+) dynamics. When applied acutely at submicromolar concentration, as either oligomers or monomers, Aβ42 did not cause Ca(2+) release or Ca(2+) influx. Similarly, 1-hour treatment with Aβ42 modified neither the resting cytosolic Ca(2+) level nor the long-lasting Ca(2+) influx caused by KCl-induced depolarization. In contrast, Aβ42 oligomers, but not monomers, significantly altered Ca(2+) release from stores with opposite effects on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)- and caffeine-induced Ca(2+) mobilization without alteration of the total store Ca(2+) content. Ca(2+) dysregulation by Aβ42 oligomers involves metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and requires network activity and the intact exo-endocytotic machinery, being prevented by tetrodotoxin and tetanus toxin. These findings support the idea that Ca(2+) store dysfunction is directly involved in Aβ42 neurotoxicity and represents a potential therapeutic target in AD-like dementia.},

	Abstract = {Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is an important regulator of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion from pituitary corticotroph cells. The intracellular signaling system that underlies this process involves modulation of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel activity, which leads to the generation of Ca2+ action potentials and influx of Ca2+. However, the mechanisms by which Ca2+ channel activity is modulated in corticotrophs are not currently known. We investigated this process in a Hodgkin-Huxley-type mathematical model of corticotroph plasma membrane electrical responses. We found that an increase in the L-type Ca2+ current was sufficient to generate action potentials from a previously resting state of the model. The increase in the L-type current could be elicited by either a shift in the voltage dependence of the current toward more negative potentials, or by an increase in the conductance of the current. Although either of these mechanisms is potentially responsible for the generation of action potentials, previous experimental evidence favors the former mechanism, with the magnitude of the shift required being consistent with the experimental findings. The model also shows that the T-type Ca2+ current plays a role in setting the excitability of the plasma membrane, but does not appear to contribute in a dynamic manner to action potential generation. Inhibition of a K+ conductance that is active at rest also affects the excitability of the plasma membrane.},

	Abstract = {We have previously described a model for corticotroph plasma membrane electrophysiology [LeBeau et al. (1997). Biophysical Journal 73, 1263-1275]. The model is a Hodgkin-Huxley-like formalism consisting of six coupled ordinary differential equations. Analysis of this model showed that Ca2+ action potentials could be induced by an increase in the L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ current. Thus we have demonstrated a putative causal link between an increase in the corticotroph Ca2+ current and action potential generation. We report here the reduction of the model to one with three equations, the behaviour of which was found to correspond well with that of the full model. The reduced model was then subjected to fast-slow subsystem analysis, which revealed the mechanistic interaction between the membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ concentration that underlies action potential generation. Insights obtained from this analysis were used to investigate experimentally observed aspects of corticotroph electrophysiology such as spontaneous electrical activity, bursting action potentials, and observations from anode break excitation experiments.},

	Abstract = {The properties of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells depend crucially on the agonist used to stimulate them. Acetylcholine or carbachol (CCh) cause high-frequency (10-12-s period) calcium oscillations that are superimposed on a raised baseline, while cholecystokinin (CCK) causes long-period (>100-s period) baseline spiking. We show that physiological concentrations of CCK induce rapid phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor, which is not true of physiological concentrations of CCh. Based on this and other experimental data, we construct a mathematical model of agonist-specific intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells. Model simulations agree with previous experimental work on the rates of activation and inactivation of the IP3 receptor by calcium (DuFour, J.-F., I.M. Arias, and T.J. Turner. 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272:2675-2681), and reproduce both short-period, raised baseline oscillations, and long-period baseline spiking. The steady state open probability curve of the model IP3 receptor is an increasing function of calcium concentration, as found for type-III IP3 receptors by Hagar et al. (Hagar, R.E., A.D. Burgstahler, M.H. Nathanson, and B.E. Ehrlich. 1998. Nature. 396:81-84). We use the model to predict the effect of the removal of external calcium, and this prediction is confirmed experimentally. We also predict that, for type-III IP3 receptors, the steady state open probability curve will shift to lower calcium concentrations as the background IP3 concentration increases. We conclude that the differences between CCh- and CCK-induced calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells can be explained by two principal mechanisms: (a) CCK causes more phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor than does CCh, and the phosphorylated receptor cannot pass calcium current; and (b) the rate of calcium ATPase pumping and the rate of calcium influx from the outside the cell are greater in the presence of CCh than in the presence of CCK.},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from native and immortalized hypothalamic neurons is regulated by endogenous Ca(2+)-mobilizing and adenylyl cyclase (AC)-coupled receptors. Activation of both receptor types leads to an increase in action potential firing frequency and a rise in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and neuropeptide secretion. The stimulatory action of Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists on voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx is determined by depletion of the intracellular Ca(2+) pool, whereas AC agonist-stimulated Ca(2+) influx occurs independently of stored Ca(2+) and is controlled by cAMP, possibly through cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Here, experimental records from immortalized GnRH-secreting neurons are simulated with a mathematical model to determine the requirements for generating complex membrane potential (V(m)) and [Ca(2+)](i) responses to Ca(2+)-mobilizing and AC agonists. Included in the model are three pacemaker currents: a store-operated Ca(2+) current (I(SOC)), an SK-type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current (I(SK)), and an inward current that is modulated by cAMP and [Ca(2+)](i) (I(d)). Spontaneous electrical activity and Ca(2+) signaling in the model are predominantly controlled by I(d), which is activated by cAMP and inhibited by high [Ca(2+)](i). Depletion of the intracellular Ca(2+) pool mimics the receptor-induced activation of I(SOC) and I(SK), leading to an increase in the firing frequency and Ca(2+) influx after a transient cessation of electrical activity. However, increasing the activity of I(d) simulates the experimental response to forskolin-induced activation of AC. Analysis of the behaviors of I(SOC), I(d), and I(SK) in the model reveals the complexity in the interplay of these currents that is necessary to fully account for the experimental results.},

	Abstract = {Complex, spatiotemporal patterns of intracellular Ca2+ release in Xenopus oocytes can be accounted for by the operation of two fundamental processes: Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) with its inherent dependency on cytosolic Ca2+, and Ca2+ uptake via Ca2+ ATPases. Overexpression of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCAs) in Xenopus oocytes, increases IP3-induced Ca2+ wave frequency and amplitude [1-3]. This effect can be attributed to an increased removal of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and more efficient refilling of Ca2+ stores. By overexpressing SERCA isoforms, we report here that Ca2+ waves exhibit dispersion [4-6]. At wavelengths greater than 60 microns, wave velocity is constant. However, wave velocity and amplitude progressively decreases at smaller wavelengths. Below gamma approximately 20 microns, Ca2+ waves disperse and fail to propagate. In oocytes exhibiting both spiral and target patterns of Ca2+ release, spiral waves had higher frequencies and showed entrainment of the surrounding regions. These properties are characteristic of a classical excitable medium [4-6].},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons release GnRH in a pulsatile manner to control fertility in all mammals. The mechanisms underlying burst firing in GnRH neurons, thought to contribute to pulsatile GnRH release, are not yet understood. Using minimally invasive, dual electrical-calcium recordings in acute brain slices from GnRH-Pericam transgenic mice, we find that the soma/proximal dendrites of GnRH neurons exhibit long-duration (approximately 10 s) calcium transients that are perfectly synchronized with their burst firing. These transients were found to be generated by calcium entry through voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels that was amplified by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-dependent store mechanisms. Perforated-patch current- and voltage-clamp electrophysiology coupled with mathematical modeling approaches revealed that these broad calcium transients act to control two slow afterhyperpolarization currents (sI(AHP)) in GnRH neurons: a quick-activating apamin-sensitive sI(AHP) that regulates both intraburst and interburst dynamics, and a slow-onset UCL2077-sensitive sI(AHP) that regulates only interburst dynamics. These observations highlight a unique interplay between electrical activity, calcium dynamics, and multiple calcium-regulated sI(AHP)s critical for shaping GnRH neuron burst firing.},

	Abstract = {Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) act as pacemaker cells in the gastrointestinal tract by generating electrical slow waves to regulate rhythmic smooth muscle contractions. Intrinsic Ca(2+) oscillations in ICC appear to produce the slow waves by activating pacemaker currents, currently thought to be carried by the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel anoctamin 1 (Ano1). In this article we present a novel model of small intestinal ICC pacemaker activity that incorporates store-operated Ca(2+) entry and a new model of Ano1 current. A series of simulations were carried out with the ICC model to investigate current controversies about the reversal potential of the Ano1 Cl(-) current in ICC and to predict the characteristics of the other ion channels that are necessary to generate slow waves. The model results show that Ano1 is a plausible pacemaker channel when coupled to a store-operated Ca(2+) channel but suggest that small cyclical depolarizations may still occur in ICC in Ano1 knockout mice. The results predict that voltage-dependent Ca(2+) current is likely to be negligible during the slow wave plateau phase. The model shows that the Cl(-) equilibrium potential is an important modulator of slow wave morphology, highlighting the need for a better understanding of Cl(-) dynamics in ICC.},

	Abstract = {To ascertain the coupling between Ca2+ and H+ fluxes during Ca2+ transport by the Ca2(+)-pumping ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, we used well characterized reconstituted proteoliposomes. The method for the functional reconstitution of the Ca2(+)-ATPase was an extension of our recently published procedure (Rigaud, J. L., Paternostre, M. T., and Bluzat, A. (1988) Biochemistry, 27, 2677-2688). The reconstituted vesicles which sustained high Ca2+ transport activities in the absence of Ca2+ precipitating anions exhibited low ionic passive permeability. Proton fluxes generated by external acid pulses have been monitored by using the fluorescence of the pH-sensitive probe pyranine trapped inside proteliposomes. When K+ was the only permeant ion, low proton-hydroxyl passive permeability was found (permeability coefficient congruent to 5 x 10(-5) cm s-1). In the presence of Cl-1 ions, a higher proton permeability was observed, presumably due to diffusion of HCl molecules. It was further demonstrated that systematic characterization of the passive permeability is essential for understanding and controlling the ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation in the reconstituted liposomes. The first line of evidence for Ca2(+)-H+ countertransport during operation of the Ca2(+)-ATPase came from Ca2+ uptake measurements. The ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation into proteoliposomes was shown to be critically dependent upon the ionic composition of the medium and the presence of ionophores. In K2SO4 medium a very low Ca2+ uptake was obtained which was only slightly affected by the presence of valinomycin. On the contrary, Ca2+ accumulation was increased 3-4-fold in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl-cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone, indicating that a transmembrane pH gradient was built up during Ca2+ uptake that inhibited the transport activity of the pump. Accordingly, we found that Ca2+ loading capacity increased with internal buffer capacity. Finally in KCl medium, high Ca2+ accumulation was observed even in the absence of protonophore in agreement with a rapid dissipation of the pH gradient in the presence of chloride ions. Additional evidence that the Ca2+ pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum operated as a Ca2(+)-H+ countertransport was provided by measurements of ATP-dependent intraliposomal alkalinization using entrapped 8-hydroxyl-1,3,6-pyrene trisulfonate (pyranine) and accumulation of the weak acid acetate. In K2SO4 medium, transmembrane pH gradients of about 1 pH unit were generated with kinetics parallel to those of the Ca2+ uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

ICWs occur in a wide diversity of cells and have been extensively studied in vitro. More recent studies focus on ICWs in vivo. ICWs are triggered by a variety of stimuli and involve the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores. The propagation of ICWs predominately involves cell communication with internal messengers moving via gap junctions or extracellular messengers mediating paracrine signaling. ICWs appear to be important in both normal physiology as well as pathophysiological processes in a variety of organs and tissues including brain, liver, retina, cochlea, and vascular tissue. We review here the mechanisms of initiation and propagation of ICWs, the key intra- and extracellular messengers (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ATP) mediating ICWs, and the proposed physiological functions of ICWs.},

	Abstract = {Single pituitary cells often fire spontaneous action potentials (APs), which are believed to underlie spiking fluctuations in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). To address how these basal [Ca2+]i fluctuations depend on changes in plasma membrane voltage (V), simultaneous measurements of V and [Ca2+]i were performed in rat pituitary gonadotrophs. The data show that each [Ca2+]i spike is produced by the Ca2+ entry during a single AP. Using these and previously obtained patch-clamp data, we develop a quantitative mathematical model of this plasma membrane oscillator and the accompanying spatiotemporal [Ca2+]i oscillations. The model demonstrates that AP-induced [Ca2+]i spiking is prominent only in a thin shell layer neighboring the cell surface. This localized [Ca2+]i spike transiently activates the Ca2(+)- dependent K+ current resulting in a sharp afterhyperpolarization following each voltage spike. In accord with experimental observations, the model shows that the frequency and amplitude of the voltage spikes are highly sensitive to current injection and to the blocking of the Ca(2+)-sensitive current. Computations also predict that leaving the membrane channels intact, the firing rate can be modified by changing the Ca2+ handling parameters: the Ca2+ diffusion rate, the Ca2+ buffering capacity, and the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump rate. Finally, the model suggests reasons that spontaneous APs were seen in some gonadotrophs but not in others. This model provides a basis for further exploring how plasma membrane electrical activity is involved in the control of cytosolic calcium level in unstimulated as well as agonist-stimulated gonadotrophs.},

	Abstract = {Recent research dealing with experiments and theoretical models of Ca2+ excitability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is reviewed. Ca2+ excitability refers to the ability of a small increment of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) to trigger a large [Ca2+]i pulse or oscillations. Such nonlinear regenerative behavior is conferred by the existence of IP3 channels and Ca(2+)-ATPase transporters on the ER membrane, which extends throughout the cytoplasm. Ca2+ excitability resembles the plasma membrane electrical excitability of neurons and other cells: it is driven by the ionic concentration gradient across the ER membrane (higher Ca2+ concentration inside the ER); each [Ca2+]i spike partially consumes the prestored energy that is reestablished through ATP-dependent active transport; and [Ca2+]i, the excitation variable, controls the nonlinear dynamic release rate of ER Ca2+. This review focuses on the kinetic models based on these features and on experiments dealing with the kinetic properties of [Ca2+]i-dependent gating of the IP3 receptor channel. We summarize evidence in favor of two roles for [Ca2+]i in gating the channel&apos;s opening: activation at a rapid time scale and inactivation on a slower time scale. Exploiting an analogy to the well-known Hodgkin-Huxley model for neuronal electrical excitability, we show how Ca2+ excitability of the ER membrane can be explained by these gating properties combined with the ER Ca2+ pump activity. The theory&apos;s ability to predict is illustrated by comparing calculated with experimental [Ca2+]i responses for pituitary gonadotrophs under various stimulus conditions.},

	Abstract = {Short-lived, localized Ca(2+) events mediate Ca(2+) signaling with high efficiency and great fidelity largely as a result of the close proximity between Ca(2+)-permeable ion channels and their molecular targets. However, in most cases, direct evidence of the spatial relationship between these two types of molecules is lacking, and, thus, mechanistic understanding of local Ca(2+) signaling is incomplete. In this study, we use an integrated approach to tackling this issue on a prototypical local Ca(2+) signaling system composed of Ca(2+) sparks resulting from the opening of ryanodine receptors (RYRs) and spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) caused by the opening of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels in airway smooth muscle. Biophysical analyses of STOCs and Ca(2+) sparks acquired at 333 Hz demonstrate that these two events are associated closely in time, and approximately eight RYRs open to give rise to a Ca(2+) spark, which activates ∼15 BK channels to generate a STOC at 0 mV. Dual immunocytochemistry and 3-D deconvolution at high spatial resolution reveal that both RYRs and BK channels form clusters and RYR1 and RYR2 (but not RYR3) localize near the membrane. Using the spatial relationship between RYRs and BK channels, the spatial-temporal profile of [Ca(2+)] resulting from Ca(2+) sparks, and the kinetic model of BK channels, we estimate that an average Ca(2+) spark caused by the opening of a cluster of RYR1 or RYR2 acts on BK channels from two to three clusters that are randomly distributed within an ∼600-nm radius of RYRs. With this spatial organization of RYRs and BK channels, we are able to model BK channel currents with the same salient features as those observed in STOCs across a range of physiological membrane potentials. Thus, this study provides a mechanistic understanding of the activation of STOCs by Ca(2+) sparks using explicit knowledge of the spatial relationship between RYRs (the Ca(2+) source) and BK channels (the Ca(2+) target).},

We also suggest how recently discovered binding interactions could provide a structural readout mechanism: the autophosphorylated state of CaMKII binds tightly to the NMDAR and forms, through CaMKII-actinin-actin-(4.1/SAP97) linkages, additional sites for anchoring AMPARs at synapses.

	Abstract = {The glucagon-releasing pancreatic alpha-cells are electrically excitable cells but the signal transduction leading to depolarization and secretion is not well understood. To clarify the mechanisms we studied [Ca(2+)](i) and membrane potential in individual mouse pancreatic alpha-cells using fluorescent indicators. The physiological secretagogue l-adrenaline increased [Ca(2+)](i) causing a peak, which was often followed by maintained oscillations or sustained elevation. The early effect was due to mobilization of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the late one to activation of store-operated influx of the ion resulting in depolarization and Ca(2+) influx through voltage-dependent L-type channels. Consistent with such mechanisms, the effects of adrenaline on [Ca(2+)](i) and membrane potential were mimicked by inhibitors of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase. The alpha-cells express ATP-regulated K(+) (K(ATP)) channels, whose activation by diazoxide leads to hyperpolarization. The resulting inhibition of the voltage-dependent [Ca(2+)](i) response to adrenaline was reversed when the K(ATP) channels were inhibited by tolbutamide. However, tolbutamide alone rarely affected [Ca(2+)](i), indicating that the K(ATP) channels are normally closed in mouse alpha-cells. Glucose, which is the major physiological inhibitor of glucagon secretion, hyperpolarized the alpha-cells and inhibited the late [Ca(2+)](i) response to adrenaline. At concentrations as low as 3mM, glucose had a pronounced stimulatory effect on Ca(2+) sequestration in the ER amplifying the early [Ca(2+)](i) response to adrenaline. We propose that adrenaline stimulation and glucose inhibition of the alpha-cell involve modulation of a store-operated current, which controls a depolarizing cascade leading to opening of L-type Ca(2+) channels. Such a control mechanism may be unique among excitable cells.},

	Abstract = {We derive a continuum model, called the Poisson-Fermi equation, of biological calcium channels (of cardiac muscle, for example) designed to deal with crowded systems in which ionic species and side chains nearly fill space. The model is evaluated in three dimensions. It includes steric and correlation effects and is derived from classical hard-sphere lattice models of configurational entropy of finite size ions and solvent molecules. The maximum allowable close packing (saturation) condition is satisfied by all ionic species with different sizes and valences in a channel system, as shown theoretically and numerically. Unphysical overcrowding ("divergence") predicted by the Gouy-Chapman diffuse model (produced by a Boltzmann distribution of point charges with large potentials) does not occur with the Fermi-like distribution. Using probability theory, we also provide an analytical description of the implicit dielectric model of ionic solutions that gives rise to a global and a local formula for the chemical potential. In this primitive model, ions are treated as hard spheres and solvent molecules are described as a dielectric medium. The Poisson-Fermi equation is a local formula dealing with different correlations at different places. The correlation effects are apparent in our numerical results. Our results show variations of dielectric permittivity from bath to channel pore described by a new dielectric function derived as an output from the Poisson-Fermi analysis. The results are consistent with existing theoretical and experimental results. The binding curve of Poisson-Fermi is shown to match Monte Carlo data and illustrates the anomalous mole fraction effect of calcium channels, an effective blockage of permeation of sodium ions by a tiny concentration (or number) of calcium ions.},

	Abstract = {A Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Fermi (PNPF) theory is developed for studying ionic transport through biological ion channels. Our goal is to deal with the finite size of particle using a Fermi like distribution without calculating the forces between the particles, because they are both expensive and tricky to compute. We include the steric effect of ions and water molecules with nonuniform sizes and interstitial voids, the correlation effect of crowded ions with different valences, and the screening effect of water molecules in an inhomogeneous aqueous electrolyte. Including the finite volume of water and the voids between particles is an important new part of the theory presented here. Fermi like distributions of all particle species are derived from the volume exclusion of classical particles. Volume exclusion and the resulting saturation phenomena are especially important to describe the binding and permeation mechanisms of ions in a narrow channel pore. The Gibbs free energy of the Fermi distribution reduces to that of a Boltzmann distribution when these effects are not considered. The classical Gibbs entropy is extended to a new entropy form - called Gibbs-Fermi entropy - that describes mixing configurations of all finite size particles and voids in a thermodynamic system where microstates do not have equal probabilities. The PNPF model describes the dynamic flow of ions, water molecules, as well as voids with electric fields and protein charges. The model also provides a quantitative mean-field description of the charge/space competition mechanism of particles within the highly charged and crowded channel pore. The PNPF results are in good accord with experimental currents recorded in a 10(8)-fold range of Ca(2+) concentrations. The results illustrate the anomalous mole fraction effect, a signature of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, numerical results concerning water density, dielectric permittivity, void volume, and steric energy provide useful details to study a variety of physical mechanisms ranging from binding, to permeation, blocking, flexibility, and charge/space competition of the channel.},

	Abstract = {The anomalous mole fraction effect of L-type calcium channels is analyzed using a Fermi like distribution with the experimental data of Almers and McCleskey [J. Physiol. 353, 585 (1984)] and the atomic resolution model of Lipkind and Fozzard [Biochemistry 40, 6786 (2001)] of the selectivity filter of the channel. Much of the analysis is algebraic, independent of differential equations. The Fermi distribution is derived from the configuration entropy of ions and water molecules with different sizes, different valences, and interstitial voids between particles. It allows us to calculate potentials and distances (between the binding ion and the oxygen ions of the glutamate side chains) directly from the experimental data using algebraic formulas. The spatial resolution of these results is comparable with those of molecular models, but of course the accuracy is no better than that implied by the experimental data. The glutamate side chains in our model are flexible enough to accommodate different types of binding ions in different bath conditions. The binding curves of Na(+) and Ca(2+) for [CaCl2] ranging from 10(-8) to 10(-2) M with a fixed 32 mM background [NaCl] are shown to agree with published Monte Carlo simulations. The Poisson-Fermi differential equation-that includes both steric and correlation effects-is then used to obtain the spatial profiles of energy, concentration, and dielectric coefficient from the solvent region to the filter. The energy profiles of ions are shown to depend sensitively on the steric energy that is not taken into account in the classical rate theory. We improve the rate theory by introducing a steric energy that lumps the effects of excluded volumes of all ions and water molecules and empty spaces between particles created by Lennard-Jones type and electrostatic forces. We show that the energy landscape varies significantly with bath concentrations. The energy landscape is not constant.},

	Abstract = {Skeletal muscle contraction is triggered by a rise in calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration in the myofibrillar space. The objective of this study was to develop a voltage dependent compartment model of Ca(2+) dynamics in frog skeletal muscle fibers. The compartment model corresponds to the myofibrillar space (MS) and a calcium store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Ca(2+) is released from the SR to the MS based on the voltage and is able to bind to several proteins in the MS. We use a detailed model to account for voltage dependent Ca(2+) release and inactivation. With this model, we are able to match previous experimental data for Ca(2+) release and binding to proteins for an applied (fixed) voltage. We explore the sensitivity of parameters in the model and illustrate the importance of inactivation of the SR; during a long depolarization, the SR must be inactivated in order to achieve realistic Ca(2+) concentrations in the MS. A Hodgkin Huxley type model was also developed to describe voltage at the surface membrane using electrophysiological data from previous experiments. This voltage model was then used as the time dependent voltage to determine Ca(2+) release from the SR. With this fully coupled model, we were able to match previous experimental results for Ca(2+) concentrations for a given applied current. Additionally, we examined simulated Ca(2+) concentrations in the case of twitch and tetanus, corresponding to different applied currents. The developed model is robust and reproduces many aspects of voltage dependent calcium signaling in frog skeletal muscle fibers. This modeling framework provides a platform for future studies of excitation contraction coupling in skeletal muscle fibers.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between the cellular Ca2+ signal and secretory vesicle fusion (exocytosis) is a key determinant of the regulation of the kinetics and magnitude of the secretory response. Here, we have investigated secretion in cells where the exocytic response is controlled by Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Using live-cell two-photon microscopy that simultaneously records Ca2+signals and exocytic responses, we provide evidence that secretion is controlled by changes in Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+] in relatively large-volume microdomains. Our evidence includes: (1) long latencies (>2 seconds) between the rise in [Ca2+] and exocytosis, (2) observation of exocytosis all along the lumen and not clustered around Ca2+ release hot-spots, (3) high affinity (Kd=1.75 microM) Ca2+dependence of exocytosis, (4) significant reduction in exocytosis in the presence of cytosolic EGTA, (5) spatial exclusion of secretory granules from the cell membrane by the endoplasmic reticulum, and (6) inability of local Ca2+ responses to trigger exocytosis. These results strongly indicate that the control of exocytosis, triggered by Ca2+ release from stores, is through the regulation of cytosolic[Ca2+] within a microdomain.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) signaling is of vital importance to cardiac cell function and plays an important role in heart failure. It is based on sarcolemmal, sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial Ca(2+) cycling. While the first two are well characterized, the latter remains unclear, controversial and technically challenging. In mammalian cardiac myocytes, Ca(2+) influx through L-type calcium channels in the sarcolemmal membrane triggers Ca(2+) release from the nearby junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum to produce Ca(2+) sparks. When this triggering is synchronized by the cardiac action potential, a global [Ca(2+)](i) transient arises from coordinated Ca(2+) release events. The ends of intermyofibrillar mitochondria are located within 20 nm of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and thereby experience a high local [Ca(2+)] during the Ca(2+) release process. Both local and global Ca(2+) signals may thus influence calcium signaling in mitochondria and, reciprocally, mitochondria may contribute to the local control of calcium signaling. In addition to the intermyofibrillar mitochondria, morphologically distinct mitochondria are also located in the perinuclear and subsarcolemmal regions of the cardiomyocyte and thus experience a different local [Ca(2+)]. Here we review the literature in regard to several issues of broad interest: (1) the ultrastructural basis for mitochondrion - sarcoplasmic reticulum cross-signaling; (2) mechanisms of sarcoplasmic reticulum signaling; (3) mitochondrial calcium signaling; and (4) the possible interplay of calcium signaling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and adjacent mitochondria. Finally, this review discusses experimental findings and mathematical models of cardiac calcium signaling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, identifies weaknesses in these models, and suggests strategies and approaches for future investigations.},

	Abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) make up the largest and most diverse family of membrane receptors in the human genome, relaying information about the presence of diverse extracellular stimuli to the cell interior. All known GPCRs share a common architecture of seven membrane-spanning helices connected by intra- and extracellular loops. Most GPCR-mediated cellular responses result from the receptor acting as a ligand-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factor for heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins whose dissociated subunits activate effector enzymes or ion channels. GPCR signaling is subject to extensive negative regulation through receptor desensitization, sequestration, and down regulation, termination of G protein activation by GTPase-activation proteins, and enzymatic degradation of second messengers. Additional protein-protein interactions positively modulate GPCR signaling by influencing ligand-binding affinity and specificity, coupling between receptors, G proteins and effectors, or targeting to specific subcellular locations. These include the formation of GPCR homo- and heterodimers, the interaction of GPCRs with receptor activity-modifying proteins, and the binding of various scaffolding proteins to intracellular receptor domains. In some cases, these processes appear to generate signals in conjunction with, or even independent of, G protein activation.},

	Abstract = {The universal signal for egg activation at fertilization is a rise in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) with defined spatial and temporal kinetics. Mammalian and amphibian eggs acquire the ability to produce such Ca(2+) signals during a maturation period that precedes fertilization and encompasses resumption of meiosis and progression to metaphase II. In Xenopus, immature oocytes produce fast, saltatory Ca(2+) waves that can be oscillatory in nature in response to IP(3). In contrast, mature eggs produce a single continuous, sweeping Ca(2+) wave in response to IP(3) or sperm fusion. The mechanisms mediating the differentiation of Ca(2+) signaling during oocyte maturation are not well understood. Here, I characterized elementary Ca(2+) release events (Ca(2+) puffs) in oocytes and eggs and show that the sensitivity of IP(3)-dependent Ca(2+) release is greatly enhanced during oocyte maturation. Furthermore, Ca(2+) puffs in eggs have a larger spatial fingerprint, yet are short lived compared to oocyte puffs. Most interestingly, Ca(2+) puffs cluster during oocyte maturation resulting in a continuum of Ca(2+) release sites over space in eggs. These changes in the spatial distribution of elementary Ca(2+) release events during oocyte maturation explain the continuous nature and slower speed of the fertilization Ca(2+) wave.},

	Abstract = {We develop a simplified, but useful, mathematical model to describe Ca2+ handling by mitochondria in the pancreatic beta-cell. The model includes the following six transport mechanisms in the inner mitochondrial membrane: proton pumping via respiration and proton uptake by way of the F1Fzero-ATPase (adapted from D. Pietrobon and S. Caplan. Biochemistry 24: 5764-5778, 1985), a proton leak, adenine nucleotide exchange, the Ca2+ uniporter, and Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Each mechanism is developed separately into a kinetic model for the rate of transport, with parameters taken from experiments on isolated mitochondrial preparations. These mechanisms are combined in a modular fashion first to describe state 4 (nonphosphorylating) and state 3 (phosphorylating) mitochondria with mitochondrial NADH and Ca2+ concentrations as fixed parameters and then to describe Ca2+ handling with variable mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration. Simulations are compared to experimental measurements and agree well with the threshold for Ca2+ uptake, measured mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, and the influence of Ca2+ on oxygen uptake. In the absence of Ca2+ activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, the simulations predict a significant reduction in the rate of production of ATP that involves a &quot;short circuit&quot; via Ca2+ uptake through the uniporter. This effect suggests a potential role for mitochondrial Ca2+ handling in determining the ATP-ADP ratio in the pancreatic beta-cell.},

J. 56: 229-242, 1989), including the influence of Ca2+ handling by the mitochondria. Our minimal model of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling [G. Magnus and J. Keizer. Am. J. Physiol. 273 (Cell Physiol. 42): C717-C733, 1997] is expanded to include the D-glucose dependence of the rate of production of mitochondrial reducing equivalents. The Ca2+ dependence of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which is also included in the model, plays only a small role in the simulations, since the dehydrogenases appear to be maximally activated when D-glucose concentrations are sufficient to produce bursting. A previous model of ionic currents in the plasma membrane is updated using a recent experimental characterization of the dependence of the conductance of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) current on adenine nucleotides. The resulting whole cell model is complex, involving 12 dynamic variables that couple Ca2+ handling in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria with electrical activity in the plasma and inner mitochondrial membranes. Simulations with the whole cell model give rise to bursting electrical activity similar to that seen in pancreatic islets and clusters of pancreatic beta-cells. The full D-glucose dose response of electrical activity is obtained if the cytosolic rate of ATP hydrolysis is a sigmoidal function of glucose. The simulations give the correct shape, period, and phase of the associated oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+, predict that the conductance of the KATP current oscillates out of phase with electrical activity [as recently observed in ob/ob mice (O. Larsson, H. Kindmark, R. Br{\"a}nstrom, B. Fredholm, and P.-O. Berggren. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 5161-5165, 1996)], and make other novel predictions. In this model, bursting results because Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria during the active phase reduces the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, reducing the rate of production of ATP, which in turn activates the KATP current and repolarizes the plasma membrane.},

Physiol. 274 (Cell Physiol. 43): C1158-C1173, 1998], we describe the development of a kinetic model for the interaction of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell. Here we describe further results of those simulations, focusing on mitochondrial variables, the rate of respiration, and fluxes of metabolic intermediates as a function of D-glucose concentration. Our simulations predict relatively smooth increases of O2 consumption, adenine nucleotide transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production by the tricarboxylic acid cycle as D-glucose concentrations are increased from basal to 20 mM. On the other hand, we find that the active fraction of pyruvate dehydrogenase saturates, due to increases in matrix Ca2+, near the onset of bursting electrical activity and that the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the mitochondria increases by roughly an order of magnitude as glucose concentrations are increased. The mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio increases by factor of < 2 between the D-glucose threshold for bursting and continuous spiking. According to our simulations, relatively small changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (approximately 1 mV) caused by uptake of Ca2+ are sufficient to alter the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio and influence ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the plasma membrane. In the simulations, these cyclic changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential are due to synchronization of futile cycle of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm through mitochondria via Ca2+ uniporters and Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Our simulations predict steady mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations on the order of 0.1 microM at low glucose concentrations that become oscillatory with an amplitude on the order of 0.5 microM during bursting. Abrupt increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration > 5 microM may occur during continuous electrical activity.},

Understanding how complex Ca(2+) signals are generated has been hindered by a lack of information on the kinetic responses of the channel to its primary ligands, InsP(3) and Ca(2+), which activate and inhibit channel gating. Here, we describe the kinetic responses of single InsP(3)R channels in native endoplasmic reticulum membrane to rapid ligand concentration changes with millisecond resolution, using a new patch-clamp configuration. The kinetics of channel activation and deactivation showed novel Ca(2+) regulation and unexpected ligand cooperativity. The kinetics of Ca(2+)-mediated channel inhibition showed the single-channel bases for fundamental Ca(2+) release events and Ca(2+) release refractory periods. These results provide new insights into the channel regulatory mechanisms that contribute to complex spatial and temporal features of intracellular Ca(2+) signals.},

	Abstract = {During superfusion of permeabilized hepatocytes, submaximal concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) evoked quantal Ca2+ mobilization: a rapid acceleration in the rate of 45Ca2+ release abruptly followed by a biphasic decline to the basal rate before the InsP3-sensitive stores had fully emptied. During the fast component of the decay, the Ca2+ permeability of the stores fell rapidly by 40% (t1/2 = 250 ms) to a state indistinguishable from that evoked by preincubation with InsP3 under conditions that prevented Ca2+ mobilization. This change was accompanied by a decrease in the InsP3 dissociation rate: the response declined more quickly when InsP3 was removed during the initial stages of a response than later. We suggest that InsP3 directly causes its receptor to rapidly switch (t1/2 = 250 ms) between a low-affinity (Kd approximately 1 microM) active, and a higher-affinity (Kd approximately 100 nM) less active, conformation, and that this transition underlies the fast component of the decaying phase of Ca2+ release. Ca2+ continues to leak through the unchanging less active state of the receptor until those stores that responded initially are completely empty, accounting for the slow phase of the response. The requirements for activation of InsP3 receptors are more stringent (InsP3 and then Ca2+ binding) than those for partial inactivation (InsP3 binding); rapid inactivation is therefore likely to determine whether the cytosolic [Ca2+] reaches the threshold for regenerative Ca2+ signals.},

	Abstract = {Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP(3)) evokes Ca(2+) liberation in Xenopus oocytes as elementary events (Ca(2+) puffs) that become coupled to propagate Ca(2+) waves with increasing [IP(3)]. To investigate this transition between local and global Ca(2+) signaling, we developed an optical method for evoking rapid subcellular Ca(2+) elevations, while independently photoreleasing IP(3) and simultaneously recording confocal Ca(2+) images. Focal Ca(2+) elevations triggered waves within 100 ms of photoreleasing IP(3), compared with latencies of seconds following photorelease of IP(3) alone. Wave velocity varied with [IP(3)] but was independent of time after photorelease of IP(3), indicating that delayed wave initiation did not involve slow binding of IP(3) to its receptors. The amount of Ca(2+) required to trigger a wave was approximately 10-fold greater than the average size of puffs, and puffs showed no progressive increase in magnitude before waves initiated. Instead, Ca(2+) puffs contributed to a slow rise in basal free [Ca(2+)], which further increased puff frequency and sensitized IP(3) receptors so that individual events then triggered waves. Because the wave threshold is much greater than the size of the elementary puff, cells can employ both local and global signaling mechanisms, and the summation of stochastic behavior of elementary events allows generation of reproducible periodic waves.},

	Abstract = {Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP(3)) liberates intracellular Ca(2+) both as localized 'puffs' and as repetitive waves that encode information in a frequency-dependent manner. Using video-rate confocal imaging, together with photorelease of IP(3) in Xenopus oocytes, we investigated the roles of puffs in determining the periodicity of global Ca(2+) waves. Wave frequency is not delimited solely by cyclical recovery of the cell's ability to support wave propagation, but further involves sensitization of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release by progressive increases in puff frequency and amplitude at numerous sites during the interwave period, and accumulation of pacemaker Ca(2+), allowing a puff at a 'focal' site to trigger a subsequent wave. These specific 'focal' sites, distinguished by their higher sensitivity to IP(3) and close apposition to neighboring puff sites, preferentially entrain both the temporal frequency and spatial directionality of Ca(2+) waves. Although summation of activity from many stochastic puff sites promotes the generation of regularly periodic global Ca(2+) signals, the properties of individual Ca(2+) puffs control the kinetics of Ca(2+) spiking and the (higher) frequency of subcellular spikes in their local microdomain.},

Chem., 63 (1997) 221] by including, in addition to the ER, mitochondria as calcium stores. Simple plausible rate laws are used for the calcium uptake into, and release from, the mitochondria.

Recently, highly selective allosteric modulators of the mGluRs have been developed by several groups. These allosteric compounds provide an unprecedented degree of selectivity for individual mGluRs, allowing for more detailed functional studies on the roles of these receptors. Furthermore, the allosteric approach avoids many of the hurdles associated with the development of direct agonists as drugs, and provides a clear path forward for clinical proof-of-concept studies. Currently, both positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2 and negative allosteric modulators of mGluR5 hold promise as novel anxiolytics, and positive allosteric modulators of mGluR4 appear to be an exciting new target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.},

	Abstract = {Ion and voltage dependencies of sodium-calcium exchange current were studied in giant membrane patches from guinea pig ventricular cells after deregulation of the exchanger with chymotrypsin. (a) Under zero-trans conditions, the half-maximum concentration (Kh) of cytoplasmic calcium (Cai) for activation of the isolated inward exchange current decreased as the extracellular sodium (Nao) concentration was decreased. The Kh of cytoplasmic sodium (Nai) for activation of the isolated outward exchange current decreased as the extracellular calcium (Cao) concentration was decreased. (b) The current-voltage (I-V) relation of the outward exchange current with saturating concentrations of Nai and Cao had a shallow slope (twofold change in approximately 100 mV) and a slight saturation tendency at very positive potentials. The outward current gained in steepness as the Nai concentration was decreased, such that the Kh for Nai decreased with depolarization. The decrease of Kh for Nai with depolarization was well described by a Boltzmann equation (e alpha.Em/26.6) with a slope (alpha) of -0.06. (c) Voltage dependence of the outward current was lost as the Cao concentration was decreased, and the Kh for Cao increased upon depolarization with a Boltzmann slope of 0.26. (d) The I-V relation of the inward exchange current, under zero-trans conditions, was also almost linear (twofold change in approximately 100 mV) and showed some saturation tendency with hyperpolarization as the Cai concentration was decreased. The Kh for Cai decreased with depolarization (Boltzmann slope, -0.10). Voltage dependence of the inward current was decreased in the presence of a high (300 mM) Nao concentration. (e) In the presence of both Na and Ca on both membrane sides, the I-V relations with saturating Nai show sigmoidal shape and clear saturation at positive potentials. Measured reversal potentials were close to the equilibrium potential expected for a 3 Na to 1 Ca exchange. (f) Nai and Cai interacted competitively with respect to the outward current, but in a mixed competitive-noncompetitive fashion with respect to the inward current. (g) Cai inhibited the outward exchange current in a voltage-dependent manner. The half-effective concentration for inhibition (Ki) by Cai increased upon depolarization with a Boltzmann slope of 0.32 in 25 mM Nai and 0.20 in 100 mM Nai. (h) Nai also inhibited the inward exchange current voltage dependently. The Ki decreased upon depolarization (Boltzmann slope, -0.11 at 3 microM Cai and -0.10 at 1.08 mM Cai).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {We reevaluated the exchange stoichiometry of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange current by measuring its reversal potential. The exchange current was measured from the inside-out macropatch excised from intact sarcolemma of guinea pig ventricular myocytes. This method provides more accurate control of extracellular and cytoplasmic ion concentrations and of membrane potential than is possible with a whole-cell clamped preparation. The exchange current was isolated as exchanger inhibitory peptide (XIP)-sensitive current or as cytoplasmic Na(+)- and Ca(2+)-induced current. The reversal potential of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange current was, for the most part, close to the equilibrium potential of the 4Na(+):1Ca(2+) exchange, although it tended to get closer to that of 3Na(+): 1Ca(2+) exchange at lower Na(+) concentrations. We concluded that the stoichiometry is 4 or that it may vary depending on the cytoplasmic Na(+). The 4Na(+):1Ca(2+) exchange was further studied with computer modeling. A consecutive 4Na(+):1Ca(2+) exchange model with two active states and two inactive states (E2 model) could not well reconstruct the current-voltage relation of the exchanger. However, a consecutive 4Na(+):1Ca(2+) exchange model with 10 active states and 2 inactive states (E10 model), which included voltage-dependent Na(+) and Ca(2+) occlusions, well simulated the current-voltage relation. Implications of 4Na(+):1Ca(2+) exchange is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {1. Intracellular recordings of membrane potentials have been made in vitro from the exocrine acinar cells of the mouse pancreas using glass micro-electrodes.2. The mean membrane potential of the acinar cells during superfusion with Krebs-Henseleit solution was -39.2 mV. Increasing [K](o) tenfold decreased the membrane potential by 28 mV when [K](o) was above 10 mM. This depolarization was not affected by atropine (1.4 x 10(-6)M). Strophanthin-G (10(-3)M) slowly depolarized the cells at about 10 mV hr(-1).3. Brief exposure to acetylcholine (ACh), 5.5 x 10(-5)M, or pancreozymin resulted in a short lasting depolarization of the acinar cells. Atropine (1.4 x 10(-6)M) blocked the depolarizing action of ACh but not that of pancreozymin. Adrenaline (5.5 x 10(-5)M) or cyclic AMP (10(-3)-10(-4)M) did not influence the membrane potential.4. The amplitude of the ACh-induced depolarization was not dependent on the presence of CO(2)/HCO(3) in the bathing fluid, but it was closely dependent on the extracellular Na concentration. However, ACh was still able to evoke a small depolarization even after prolonged exposure of the tissue to a Na-free solution.5. During exposure of the tissue to a Ca-free solution the resting membrane potential was decreased and the ACh-induced depolarization was significantly reduced. Some substances which are known in other tissues to inhibit membrane Ca(2+) currents, i.e. La(3+), D-600 and tetracaine, were able to reduce, but never abolish, the ACh-induced depolarization.6. These results suggest that the effect of ACh on the pancreatic acinar cell is to increase the permeability of the membrane to commonly occurring ions with a consequent Na-influx and a small Ca-influx.},

	Abstract = {Synaptic facilitation (SF) is a ubiquitous form of short-term plasticity, regulating synaptic dynamics on fast timescales. Although SF is known to depend on the presynaptic accumulation of Ca(2+), its precise mechanism is still under debate. Recently it has been shown that at certain central synapses SF results at least in part from the progressive saturation of an endogenous Ca(2+) buffer (Blatow et al., 2003), as proposed by Klingauf and Neher (1997). Using computer simulations, we study the magnitude of SF that can be achieved by a buffer saturation mechanism (BSM), and explore its dependence on the endogenous buffering properties. We find that a high SF magnitude can be obtained either by a global saturation of a highly mobile buffer in the entire presynaptic terminal, or a local saturation of a completely immobilized buffer. A characteristic feature of BSM in both cases is that SF magnitude depends nonmonotonically on the buffer concentration. In agreement with results of Blatow et al. (2003), we find that SF grows with increasing distance from the Ca(2+) channel cluster, and increases with increasing external Ca(2+), [Ca(2+)](ext), for small levels of [Ca(2+)](ext). We compare our modeling results with the experimental properties of SF at the crayfish neuromuscular junction, and find that the saturation of an endogenous mobile buffer can explain the observed SF magnitude and its supralinear accumulation time course. However, we show that the BSM predicts slowing of the SF decay rate in the presence of exogenous Ca(2+) buffers, contrary to experimental observations at the crayfish neuromuscular junction. Further modeling and data are required to resolve this aspect of the BSM.},

	Abstract = {Recently there has been significant interest and progress in the study of spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca(2+) that triggers exocytosis at a fast chemical synapse, which requires understanding the contribution of individual calcium channels to the release of a single vesicle. Experimental protocols provide insight into this question by probing the sensitivity of exocytosis to Ca(2+) influx. While varying extracellular or intracellular Ca(2+) concentration assesses the intrinsic biochemical Ca(2+) cooperativity of neurotransmitter release, varying the number of open Ca(2+) channels using pharmacological channel block or the tail current titration probes the cooperativity between individual Ca(2+) channels in triggering exocytosis. Despite the wide use of these Ca(2+) sensitivity measurements, their interpretation often relies on heuristic arguments. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the Ca(2+) sensitivity measures probed by these experimental protocols, present simple expressions for special cases, and demonstrate the distinction between the Ca(2+) current cooperativity, defined by the relationship between exocytosis rate and the whole-terminal Ca(2+) current magnitude, and the underlying Ca(2+) channel cooperativity, defined as the average number of channels involved in the release of a single vesicle. We find simple algebraic expressions that show that the two are different but linearly related. Further, we use three-dimensional computational modeling of buffered Ca(2+) diffusion to analyze these distinct Ca(2+) cooperativity measures, and demonstrate the role of endogenous Ca(2+) buffers on such measures. We show that buffers can either increase or decrease the Ca(2+) current cooperativity of exocytosis, depending on their concentration and the single-channel Ca(2+) current.},

	Abstract = {The number of Ca(2+) channels contributing to the exocytosis of a single neurotransmitter vesicle in a presynaptic terminal has been a question of significant interest and debate, and is important for a full understanding of localized Ca(2+) signaling in general, and synaptic physiology in particular. This is usually estimated by measuring the sensitivity of the neurotransmitter release rate to changes in the synaptic Ca(2+) current, which is varied using appropriate voltage-clamp protocols or via pharmacological Ca(2+) channel block under the condition of constant single-channel Ca(2+) current. The slope of the resulting log-log plot of transmitter release rate versus presynaptic Ca(2+) current is termed Ca(2+)current cooperativity of exocytosis, and provides indirect information about the underlying presynaptic morphology. In this review, we discuss the relationship between the Ca(2+) current cooperativity and the average number of Ca(2+) channels participating in the exocytosis of a single vesicle, termed the Ca(2+)channel cooperativity. We relate these quantities to the morphology of the presynaptic active zone. We also review experimental studies of Ca(2+) current cooperativity and its modulation during development in different classes of synapses.},

	Abstract = {Single-channel models of intracellular Ca(2+) channels such as the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and ryanodine receptor often assume that Ca(2+)-dependent transitions are mediated by a constant background [Ca(2+)] as opposed to a dynamic [Ca(2+)] representing the formation and collapse of a localized Ca(2+) domain. This assumption neglects the fact that Ca(2+) released by open intracellular Ca(2+) channels may influence subsequent gating through the processes of Ca(2+)-activation or -inactivation. We study the effect of such "residual Ca(2+)" from previous channel opening on the stochastic gating of minimal and realistic single-channel models coupled to a restricted cytoplasmic compartment. Using Monte Carlo simulation as well as analytical and numerical solution of a system of advection-reaction equations for the probability density of the domain [Ca(2+)] conditioned on the state of the channel, we determine how the steady-state open probability (p(open)) of single-channel models of Ca(2+)-regulated Ca(2+) channels depends on the time constant for Ca(2+) domain formation and collapse. As expected, p(open) for a minimal model including Ca(2+) activation increases as the domain time constant becomes large compared to the open and closed dwell times of the channel, that is, on average the channel is activated by residual Ca(2+) from previous openings. Interestingly, p(open) for a channel model that is inactivated by Ca(2+) also increases as a function of the domain time constant when the maximum domain [Ca(2+)] is fixed, because slow formation of the Ca(2+) domain attenuates Ca(2+)-mediated inactivation. Conversely, when the source amplitude of the channel is fixed, increasing the domain time constant leads to elevated domain [Ca(2+)] and decreased open probability. Consistent with these observations, a realistic De Young-Keizer-like IP(3)R model responds to residual Ca(2+) with a steady-state open probability that is a monotonic function of the domain time constant, though minimal models that include both Ca(2+)-activation and -inactivation show more complex behavior. We show how the probability density approach described here can be generalized for arbitrarily complex channel models and for any value of the domain time constant. In addition, we present a comparatively simple numerical procedure for estimating p(open) for models of Ca(2+)-regulated Ca(2+) channels in the limit of a very fast or very slow Ca(2+) domain. When the ordinary differential equation for the [Ca(2+)] in a restricted cytoplasmic compartment is replaced by a partial differential equation for the buffered diffusion of intracellular Ca(2+) in a homogeneous isotropic cytosol, we find the dependence of p(open) on the buffer time constant is qualitatively similar to the above-mentioned results.},

	Abstract = {We describe a finite-element model of mast cell calcium dynamics that incorporates the endoplasmic reticulum's complex geometry. The model is built upon a three-dimensional reconstruction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from an electron tomographic tilt series. Tetrahedral meshes provide volumetric representations of the ER lumen, ER membrane, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. The reaction-diffusion model simultaneously tracks changes in cytoplasmic and ER intraluminal calcium concentrations and includes luminal and cytoplasmic protein buffers. Transport fluxes via PMCA, SERCA, ER leakage, and Type II IP3 receptors are also represented. Unique features of the model include stochastic behavior of IP3 receptor calcium channels and comparisons of channel open times when diffusely distributed or aggregated in clusters on the ER surface. Simulations show that IP3R channels in close proximity modulate activity of their neighbors through local Ca2+ feedback effects. Cytoplasmic calcium levels rise higher, and ER luminal calcium concentrations drop lower, after IP3-mediated release from receptors in the diffuse configuration. Simulation results also suggest that the buffering capacity of the ER, and not restricted diffusion, is the predominant factor influencing average luminal calcium concentrations.},

	Abstract = {The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are responsible for producing pacemaking signals that stimulate rhythmic contractions in the gastro-intestinal system. The pacemaking signals are generated by membrane depolarizations, which are in turn linked to the integrated transport of calcium between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), through inositol-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) release, and mitochondria, through the uniporter. A non-specific cation channel (NSCC) is associated with the membrane depolarizations, and is inhibited by intracellular calcium. One theory proposes that the integrated calcium transport occurs within specific regions of the ICC called "pacemaker units," and results in localized calcium concentration reductions within these units, which in turn activate the NSCC and depolarize the membrane. We have constructed a model of the spatio-temporal calcium dynamics within an ICC pacemaker unit to determine under what conditions the local calcium concentrations may reduce below baseline. We obtain reductions of calcium concentrations below baseline but only under certain conditions. Without strong and persistent stimulation of the IP(3)R, reductions of calcium below baseline occur only with a non-physiological, time-dependent uniporter. Alternatively, sufficient IP(3)R release leads to reductions of calcium below baseline, due to depletion of the ER calcium store over the time scale of seconds, although these reductions require strong mitochondrial and ER calcium uptake.},

	Abstract = {The neurotransmitter acetylcholine, a muscarinic receptor agonist, augments glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by depolarizing the membrane to enhance voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx. To clarify the electrical events involved in this process, we measured ionic currents from a clonal beta-cell line (HIT-T15) and mouse pancreatic beta-cells. In whole-cell recordings, the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh) dose-dependently and reversibly activated a voltage-independent, nonselective current (whole-cell conductance 24 pS/pF, reversal potential of approximately -15 mV). The current, which we refer to as I(musc), was blocked by atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, and SKF 96365, a nonspecific ion channel blocker. The magnitude of the current decreased by 52% when extracellular Na(+) was removed, but was not affected by changes in extracellular Ca(2+), confirming that I(musc) is a nonselective current. To determine if I(musc) activates following release of Ca(2+) from an intracellular store, we blocked intracellular IP(3) receptors with heparin. Carbachol still activated a current in the presence of heparin, demonstrating the presence of a Ca(2+) store-independent, muscarinic agonist-activated ionic current in HIT cells. However, the store-independent current was smaller and had a more positive reversal potential (approximately 0 mV) than the current activated by CCh under control conditions. This result indicates that heparin had blocked a component of I(musc), which likely activates following release of stored Ca(2+). Depleting IP(3)-sensitive calcium stores with thapsigargin also activated a non-selective, SKF 96365-blockable current in HIT cells. The properties of this putative store-operated current were similar to the component of I(musc) that was blocked by heparin, being voltage-independent and reversing near -30 mV. We conclude that I(musc) consists of store-operated and store-independent components, both of which may contribute to the depolarizing action of muscarinic agonists on pancreatic beta-cells.},

	Abstract = {During the last decade, advances in experimental techniques and quantitative modelling have resulted in the development of the calyx of Held as one of the best preparations in which to study synaptic transmission. Here we review some of these advances, including simultaneous recording of pre- and postsynaptic currents, measuring the Ca2+ sensitivity of transmitter release, reconstructing the 3-D anatomy at the electron microscope (EM) level, and modelling the buffered diffusion of Ca2+ in the nerve terminal. An important outcome of these studies is an improved understanding of the Ca2+ signal that controls phasic transmitter release. This article illustrates the spatial and temporal aspects of the three main steps in the presynaptic signalling cascade: Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, buffered Ca2+ diffusion from the channels to releasable vesicles, and activation of the Ca2+ sensor for release. Particular emphasis is placed on how presynaptic Ca2+ buffers affect the Ca2+ signal and thus the amplitude and time course of the release probability. Since many aspects of the signalling cascade were first conceived with reference to the squid giant presynaptic terminal, we include comparisons with the squid model and revisit some of its implications. Whilst the characteristics of buffered Ca2+ diffusion presented here are based on the calyx of Held, we demonstrate the circumstances under which they may be valid for other nerve terminals at mammalian CNS synapses.},

	Abstract = {Protein secretion from acinar cells of the pancreas and parotid glands is controlled by G-protein coupled receptor activation and generation of the cellular messengers Ca(2+), diacylglycerol and cAMP. Secretory granule (SG) exocytosis shares some common characteristics with nerve, neuroendocrine and endocrine cells which are regulated mainly by elevated cell Ca(2+). However, in addition to diverse signaling pathways, acinar cells have large ∼1 μm diameter SGs (∼30 fold larger diameter than synaptic vesicles), respond to stimulation at slower rates (seconds versus milliseconds), demonstrate significant constitutive secretion, and in isolated acini, undergo sequential compound SG-SG exocytosis at the apical membrane. Exocytosis proceeds as an initial rapid phase that peaks and declines over 3 min followed by a prolonged phase that decays to near basal levels over 20-30 min. Studies indicate the early phase is triggered by Ca(2+) and involves the SG proteins VAMP2 (vesicle associated membrane protein2), Ca(2+)-sensing protein synatotagmin 1 (syt1) and the accessory protein complexin 2. The molecular details for regulation of VAMP8-mediated SG exocytosis and the prolonged phase of secretion are still emerging. Here we review the known regulatory molecules that impact the sequential exocytic process of SG tethering, docking, priming and fusion in acinar cells.},

@article{meyer1988,
	Abstract = {Many cells exhibit periodic transient increases in cytosolic calcium levels rather than a sustained rise when stimulated by a hormone or growth factor. We propose here a molecular model that accounts for periodic calcium spiking induced by a constant stimulus. Four elements give rise to repetitive calcium transients: cooperativity and positive feedback between a pair of reciprocally coupled (crosscoupled) messengers, followed by deactivation and then by reactivation. The crosscoupled messengers in our model are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and cytosolic calcium ions. The opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum by the binding of multiple molecules of InsP3 provides the required cooperativity. The stimulation of receptor-activated phospholipase C by released calcium ions leads to positive feedback. InsP3 is destroyed by a phosphatase, and calcium ion is pumped back into the endoplasmic reticulum. These processes generate bistability: the cytosolic calcium concentration abruptly increases from a basal level to a stimulated level at a threshold degree of activation of phospholipase C. Spiking further requires slow deactivation and subsequent reactivation. In our model, mitochondrial sequestration of calcium ion prevents the cytosolic level from increasing above several micromolar and enables the system to return to the basal state. When the endoplasmic reticulum calcium store is refilled to a critical level by the Ca2+-ATPase pump, cooperative positive feedback between the InsP3-gated channel and phospholipase C begins again to give the next calcium spike. The time required for the calcium level in the endoplasmic reticulum to reach a threshold sets the interval between spikes. The amplitude, shape, and period of calcium spikes calculated for this model are like those observed experimentally.},

	Abstract = {Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a synaptic, autophosphorylating kinase that is essential for learning and memory. Previous models have suggested that CaMKII functions as a bistable switch that could be the molecular correlate of long-term memory, but experiments have failed to validate these predictions. These models involved significant approximations to overcome the combinatorial complexity inherent in a multisubunit, multistate system. Here, we develop a stochastic particle-based model of CaMKII activation and dynamics that overcomes combinatorial complexity without significant approximations. We report four major findings. First, the CaMKII model system is never bistable at resting calcium concentrations, which suggests that CaMKII activity does not function as the biochemical switch underlying long-term memory. Second, the steady-state activation curves are either laserlike or steplike. Both are characterized by a well-defined threshold for activation, which suggests that thresholding is a robust feature of this system. Third, transiently activated CaMKII can maintain its activity over the time course of many experiments, and such slow deactivation may account for the few reports of bistability in the literature. And fourth, under in vivo conditions, increases in phosphatase activity can increase CaMKII activity. This is a surprising and counterintuitive effect, as dephosphorylation is generally associated with CaMKII deactivation.},

	Abstract = {We carried out a detailed mathematical analysis of the effects of length fluctuations on the dynamically evolving cross-bridge distributions, simulating those that occur in airway smooth muscle during breathing. We used the latch regulation scheme of Hai and Murphy (Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 255:C86-C94, 1988) integrated with Huxley's sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. This analysis showed that imposed length fluctuations decrease the mean number of attached bridges, depress muscle force and stiffness, and increase force-length hysteresis. At frequencies >0.1 Hz, the bond-length distribution of slowly cycling latch bridges changed little over the stretch cycle and contributed almost elastically to muscle force, but the rapidly cycling cross-bridge distribution changed substantially and dominated the hysteresis. By contrast, at frequencies <0.033 Hz this behavior was reversed: the rapid cycling cross-bridge distribution changed little, effectively functioning as a constant force generator, while the latch bridge bond distribution changed substantially and dominated the stiffness and hysteresis. The analysis showed the dissociation of force/length hysteresis and cross-bridge cycling rates when strain amplitude exceeds 3%; that is, there is only a weak coupling between net external mechanical work and the ATP consumption required for cycling cross-bridges during the oscillatory steady state. Although these results are specific to airway smooth muscle, the approach generalizes to other smooth muscles subjected to cyclic length fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular agonists mobilize Ca2+ from SERCA-comprising intracellular Ca2+ stores located in both the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ release from both these compartments was studied in HeLa cells stably expressing the luminescent Ca2+ indicator aequorin specifically targeted to these compartments. Changes in lumenal [Ca2+] as detected by the aequorin measurements were correlated with parallel changes in total Ca2+ content of the stores. The latencies and initial rates of Ca2+ release from the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum were quite similar. However, maximal Ca2+ release measured with Golgi-targeted aequorin terminated faster than that from the endoplasmic reticulum. The rate and extent of Ca2+ depletion from both compartments correlated well with the peak amplitude of the cytosolic [Ca2+] rise. Time-course experiments further revealed that the peak of the cytosolic Ca2+ response occurred before the lumenal [Ca2+] reached its lowest level. We conclude that both the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum contribute to the rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] upon agonist stimulation, but the kinetics of the Ca2+ release are different.},

	Abstract = {Cytosolic calcium acts as both a coagonist and an inhibitor of the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated Ca channel, resulting in a bell-shaped Ca dependence of channel activity (Bezprozvanny, I., J. Watras, and B.E. Ehrlich. 1991. Nature. 351:751-754; Finch, E.A., T.J. Turner, and S.M. Goldin. 1991. Science. 252: 443-446; Iino, M. 1990. J. Gen. Physiol. 95:1103-1122). The ability of Ca to inhibit channel activity, however, varies dramatically depending on InsP3 concentration (Combettes, L., Z. Hannaert-Merah, J.F. Coquil, C. Rousseau, M. Claret, S. Swillens, and P. Champeil. 1994. J. Biol. Chem. 269:17561-17571; Kaftan, E.J., B.E. Ehrlich, and J. Watras. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. 110:529-538). In the present report, we have extended the characterization of the effect of cytosolic Ca on both InsP3 binding and InsP3-gated channel kinetics, and incorporated these data into a mathematical model capable of simulating channel kinetics. We found that cytosolic Ca increased the Kd of InsP3 binding approximately 3.5-fold, but did not influence the maximal number of binding sites. The ability of Ca to decrease InsP3 binding is consistent with the rightward shift in the bell-shaped Ca dependence of InsP3-gated Ca channel activity. High InsP3 concentrations are able to overcome the Ca-dependent inhibition of channel activity, apparently due to a low affinity InsP3 binding site (Kaftan, E.J., B.E. Ehrlich, and J. Watras. 1997. J. Gen. Physiol. 110:529-538). Constants from binding analyses and channel activity determinations were used to develop a mathematical model that fits the complex Ca-dependent regulation of the type 1 InsP3-gated Ca channel. This model accurately simulated both steady state data (channel open probability and InsP3 binding) and kinetic data (channel activity and open time distributions), and yielded testable predictions with regard to the regulation of this intracellular Ca channel. Information gained from these analyses, and our current molecular model of this Ca channel, will be important for understanding the basis and regulation of intracellular Ca waves and oscillations in intact cells.},

	Abstract = {A model is developed which requires the binding of 4 Na+ to a carrier before a Ca binding site is induced on the opposite side of the membrane. Upon binding Ca, this carrier translocates Na and Ca. The existence of partially Na-loaded but nonmobile forms for the carrier (NaX, Na2X, Na3X) suffices to explain both the activating and the inhibitory effects of Na on the Ca transport reaction. Analytical expressions for Ca efflux and influx in terms of [Na]o, [Na]i, [Ca]o, [Ca]i, and Em are developed for the Na/Ca exchange system at equilibrium; these provide for a quantitative description of Ca fluxes. Under nonequilibrium conditions, appropriate modifications of the flux equations can be developed. These show a dependence of Ca efflux on [Ca]o and of Ca influx on [Ca]i. The large effect of internal ATP on Ca efflux and influx in squid axons, with no change in net Ca flux, can be understood on the single assumption that ATP changes the affinity of the carrier for Na at both faces of the membrane without providing an energy input to the transport reaction.},

	Abstract = {Immobile and mobile calcium buffers shape the calcium signal close to a channel by reducing and localizing the transient calcium increase to physiological compartments. In this paper, we focus on the impact of mobile buffers in shaping steady-state calcium gradients in the vicinity of an open channel, i.e. within its "calcium microdomain." We present a linear approximation of the combined reaction-diffusion problem, which can be solved explicitly and accounts for an arbitrary number of calcium buffers, either endogenous or added exogenously. It is valid for small saturation levels of the present buffers and shows that within a few hundred nanometers from the channel, standing calcium gradients develop in hundreds of microseconds after channel opening. It is shown that every buffer can be assigned a uniquely defined length-constant as a measure of its capability to buffer calcium close to the channel. The length-constant clarifies intuitively the significance of buffer binding and unbinding kinetics for understanding local calcium signals. Hence, we examine the parameters shaping these steady-state gradients. The model can be used to check the expected influence of single channel calcium microdomains on physiological processes such as excitation-secretion coupling or excitation-contraction coupling and to explore the differential effect of kinetic buffer parameters on the shape of these microdomains.},

	Abstract = {Diverse patterns of Ca(2+)(i) release differentially regulate Ca(2+)-sensitive enzymes and gene transcription, and generally the extent of agonist activation of phospholipase C-linked G protein-coupled receptors determines the type of Ca(2+) signal. We have studied global Ca(2+) oscillations arising through activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5a expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and find that these oscillations are largely insensitive to agonist concentration. Using an inducible receptor expression system and a non-competitive antagonist, in conjunction with the translocation of eGFP-PH(PLCdelta) to monitor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) oscillations in single cells, we show that mGluR5a density determines the frequency of these oscillations. The predominant underlying mechanism resulted from a negative feedback loop whereby protein kinase C (PKC) inhibited InsP(3) generation. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged exposure to phorbol ester revealed a second form of Ca(2+)(i) oscillation at low agonist concentrations. These Ca(2+)(i) signals showed features typical of classic repetitive Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release and were sensitive to agonist concentration. Therefore, a single receptor can stimulate two types of InsP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signal dependent upon feedback inhibition, producing two distinct means of controlling the final pattern of Ca(2+)(i) release. Our results have physiological implications for Ca(2+) signaling in general and emphasize the importance of mGluR5 surface expression for modulating synaptic plasticity.},

	Abstract = {An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ often begins as a Ca2+ wave, and this wave is thought to result from sequential activation of Ca(2+)- sensitive Ca2+ stores across the cell. We tested that hypothesis in pancreatic acinar cells, and since Ca2+ waves may regulate acinar Cl- secretion, we examined whether such waves also are important for amylase secretion. Ca2+ wave speed and direction was determined in individual cells within rat pancreatic acini using confocal line scanning microscopy. Both acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin-8 induced rapid Ca2+ waves which usually travelled in an apical-to-basal direction. Both caffeine and ryanodine, at concentrations that inhibit Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), markedly slowed the speed of these waves. Amylase secretion was increased over 3-fold in response to ACh stimulation, and this increase was preserved in the presence of ryanodine. These results indicate that 1) stimulation of either muscarinic or cholecystokinin-8 receptors induces apical-to-basal Ca2+ waves in pancreatic acinar cells, 2) the speed of such waves is dependent upon mobilization of caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores, and 3) ACh-induced amylase secretion is not inhibited by ryanodine. These observations provide direct evidence that Ca(2+)- induced Ca2+ release is important for propagation of cytosolic Ca2+ waves in pancreatic acinar cells.},

Here we use immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that the type 3 inositol trisphosphate receptor is localized to the extreme apex of pancreatic acinar cells, the region which corresponds to the trigger zone from which Ca2+i signals originate in this cell type (Kasai, H., Li, Y.X., and Miyashita, Y.

	Abstract = {Hormonal regulation of hepatocytes, via cytosolic Ca2+ signaling, is well established in higher life forms but has not been investigated in elasmobranchs. We therefore examined Ca2+ signaling in hepatocytes isolated from the little skate, Raja erinacea. In hepatocyte populations, ATP induced a rapid, biphasic increase in Ca2+, as it does in mammalian hepatocytes. Other hormones that act on mammalian hepatocytes, such as vasopressin, angiotensin, and phenylephrine, induced no such Ca2+ increase. The initial phase of the ATP-induced Ca2+ increase was seen even in Ca(2+)-free medium, whereas the late sustained phase of the increase was not. Similar dose-response curves were obtained by stimulation with ATP, ADP, UTP, and 2-methylthio-ATP. In contrast, AMP, adenosine, beta, gamma-methyl-ATP, CTP, and GTP induced little or no Ca2+ increase. In single hepatocytes, ATP, ADP, UTP, and 2-methylthio-ATP each induced a sustained increase in Ca2+ at high concentrations, but at low concentrations induced Ca2+ oscillations. A maximal concentration of ATP (100 microM) caused a marked, transient increase in bile flow in the isolated perfused skate liver, whereas 100 microM adenosine had no such effect. These findings demonstrate that skate hepatocytes possess P2 nucleotide receptors that link to intracellular plus extracellular Ca2+ mobilization, which in turn regulates bile secretion. The broad specificity of the response to ATP and related compounds suggests either that multiple types of P2 receptors are expressed by skate hepatocytes or else that these cells possess a single primitive nucleotide receptor from which other P2 subtypes subsequently evolved.},

	Abstract = {Brain function is recognized to rely on neuronal activity and signaling processes between neurons, whereas astrocytes are generally considered to play supportive roles for proper neuronal function. However, accumulating evidence indicates that astrocytes sense and control neuronal and synaptic activity, indicating that neuron and astrocytes reciprocally communicate. While this evidence has been obtained in experimental animal models, whether this bidirectional signaling between astrocytes and neurons occurs in human brain remains unknown. We have investigated the existence of astrocyte-neuron communication in human brain tissue, using electrophysiological and Ca(2+) imaging techniques in slices of the cortex and hippocampus obtained from biopsies from epileptic patients. Cortical and hippocampal human astrocytes displayed spontaneous Ca(2+) elevations that were independent of neuronal activity. Local application of transmitter receptor agonists or nerve electrical stimulation transiently elevated Ca(2+) in astrocytes, indicating that human astrocytes detect synaptic activity and respond to synaptically released neurotransmitters, suggesting the existence of neuron-to-astrocyte communication in human brain tissue. Electrophysiological recordings in neurons revealed the presence of slow inward currents (SICs) mediated by NMDA receptor activation. The frequency of SICs increased after local application of ATP that elevated astrocyte Ca(2+). Therefore, human astrocytes are able to release the gliotransmitter glutamate, which affect neuronal excitability through activation of NMDA receptors in neurons. These results reveal the existence of reciprocal signaling between neurons and astrocytes in human brain tissue, indicating that astrocytes are relevant in human neurophysiology and are involved in human brain function.},

	Abstract = {The compound fura-2 (Grynkiewicz et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3440-3450, 1985) is generally known as an indicator dye for measuring the concentration of free calcium ([Ca2+]) inside living cells. It should be appreciated, however, that this is not what it actually is. More accurately, it is a divalent metal ion chelator which changes its fluorescence properties upon complexation. Thus, [Ca2+] has to be inferred indirectly by means of the law of mass action. As a chelator, fura-2 may influence the quantity of interest, the Ca signal. On the other hand, the chelator action may be used for a number of other purposes, some of them more directly related to its molecular properties: as a chelator, competing with endogenous Ca buffers, it can be used to estimate endogenous buffers and their properties. When present at sufficiently high concentration, such that it outcompetes endogenous buffers, fura-2 reports total Ca changes and is a probe for Ca fluxes across the membrane. Here, theory and methodological considerations of such applications of fura-2 will be summarized and results on Ca buffer and Ca flux measurements derived from various methods will be compared.},

	Abstract = {The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]) has important roles in the triggering of neurotransmitter release and the regulation of short-term plasticity (STP). Transmitter release is initiated by quite high concentrations within microdomains, while short-term facilitation is strongly influenced by the global buildup of "residual calcium." A global rise in [Ca(2+)] also accelerates the recruitment of release-ready vesicles, thereby controlling the degree of short-term depression (STD) during sustained activity, as well as the recovery of the vesicle pool in periods of rest. We survey data that lead us to propose two distinct roles of [Ca(2+)] in vesicle recruitment: one accelerating "molecular priming" (vesicle docking and the buildup of a release machinery), the other promoting the tight coupling between releasable vesicles and Ca(2+) channels. Such coupling is essential for rendering vesicles sensitive to short [Ca(2+)] transients, generated during action potentials.},

We review here recent literature on [Ca(2+)]i signalling in the calyx of Held and discuss what these measurements can tell us about endogenous Ca(2+) buffers and Ca(2+) extrusion mechanisms. We conclude that in spite of the favourable experimental conditions, some unresolved questions still remain regarding absolute values for the Ca(2+)-binding ratio, the affinity of the basic fixed buffer and the Ca(2+) affinities of the major endogenous Ca(2+) binding proteins. Uncertainties about some of these presynaptic properties, including the roles of Mg(2+) and ATP (as a Mg(2+) buffer), however, extend to the point that mechanisms controlling the decay of [Ca(2+)]i signals in unperturbed terminals may have to be reconsidered.},

	Abstract = {A computational model of energy metabolism in the mammalian ventricular myocyte is developed to study the effect of cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)) transients on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The model couples the Jafri-Dudycha model for tricarboxylic acid cycle regulation to a modified version of the Magnus-Keizer model for the mitochondria. The fluxes associated with Ca(2+) uptake and efflux (i.e., the Ca(2+) uniporter and Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger) and the F(1)F(0)-ATPase were modified to better model heart mitochondria. Simulations were performed at steady state and with Ca(2+) transients at various pacing frequencies generated by the Rice-Jafri-Winslow model for the guinea pig ventricular myocyte. The effects of the Ca(2+) transients for mitochondria both adjacent to the dyadic space and in the bulk myoplasm were studied. The model shows that Ca(2+) activation of both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the F(1)F(0)-ATPase are necessary to produce increases in ATP production. The model also shows that in mitochondria located near the subspace, the large Ca(2+) transients can depolarize the mitochondrial membrane potential sufficiently to cause a transient decline in ATP production. However, this transient is of short duration, minimizing its impact on overall ATP production.},

	Abstract = {The uterine sacroplasmic reticulum (SR) takes up and stores calcium [Ca], using an ATPase (SERCA) and the Ca-buffering proteins, calsequestrin and calreticulin. This stored Ca can be released via IP(3)-gated Ca channels. Decreases in luminal Ca concentration [Ca] have been directly measured following agonist stimulation. During spontaneous contractions however, there appears to be no involvement of the SR, as Ca entry and efflux across the plasma membrane account for these phasic contractions. After over-viewing current knowledge concerning SR structure and function, we highlight three areas of research which suggest new ways of looking at the role of the SR in the uterus, although they may be controversial or speculative at the moment. Firstly, we review the evidence for the function, if any, of Ca-induced SR Ca release channels, the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and the lack of Ca sparks (the elemental release events from RyRs), in the uterus. Secondly, we ask does regulation of SERCA by the accessory protein, phospholamban, occur in the uterus and what is the effect of knocking out phospholamban on uterine activity? Thirdly, we address the question of when and how store-operated Ca entry occurs in the myometrium. By analogy with other, usually less excitable tissues, is there a mechanism that links store Ca depletion to plasma membrane Ca entry in smooth muscle cells within intact uterus and is it physiologically relevant and regulated? Are the recently described proteins ORAI and STIM-1 involved in uterine store-operated Ca entry? We end the review by integrating these new insights with previous data to present a new working model of the SR in the uterus.},

@article{nonner1998,
	Abstract = {L-type Ca channels contain a cluster of four charged glutamate residues (EEEE locus), which seem essential for high Ca specificity. To understand how this highly charged structure might produce the currents and selectivity observed in this channel, a theory is needed that relates charge to current. We use an extended Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP2) theory to compute (mean) Coulombic interactions and thus to examine the role of the mean field electrostatic interactions in producing current and selectivity. The pore was modeled as a central cylinder with tapered atria; the cylinder (i.e., &apos;&apos;pore proper&apos;&apos;) contained a uniform volume density of fixed charge equivalent to that of one to four carboxyl groups. The pore proper was assigned ion-specific, but spatially uniform, diffusion coefficients and excess chemical potentials. Thus electrostatic selection by valency was computed self-consistently, and selection by other features was also allowed. The five external parameters needed for a system of four ionic species (Na, Ca, Cl, and H) were determined analytically from published measurements of three limiting conductances and two critical ion concentrations, while treating the pore as a macroscopic ion-exchange system in equilibrium with a uniform bath solution. The extended PNP equations were solved with these parameters, and the predictions were compared to currents measured in a variety of solutions over a range of transmembrane voltages. The extended PNP theory accurately predicted current-voltage relations, anomalous mole fraction effects in the observed current, saturation effects of varied Ca and Na concentrations, and block by protons. Pore geometry, dielectric permittivity, and the number of carboxyl groups had only weak effects. The successful prediction of Ca fluxes in this paper demonstrates that ad hoc electrostatic parameters, multiple discrete binding sites, and logistic assumptions of single-file movement are all unnecessary for the prediction of permeation in Ca channels over a wide range of conditions. Further work is needed, however, to understand the atomic origin of the fixed charge, excess chemical potentials, and diffusion coefficients of the channel. The Appendix uses PNP2 theory to predict ionic currents for published &apos;&apos;barrier-and-well&apos;&apos; energy profiles of this channel.},

	Abstract = {We used fluorescence ratio imaging of fura-2 in the egg of Xenopus laevis to study the initiation and propagation of the wave of increased free Ca2+ that is normally triggered at fertilization. Naturally matured, jellied eggs were injected with fura-2 and ratio-imaged with fluorescence excitation at 350 and 385 nm while sperm were added. The [Ca2+]i rise normally begins as a small spot near the surface of the egg, remains fairly localized for 20-60 sec, and then spreads more rapidly across the egg at 7.5 +/- 0.05 microns/sec to reach the antipode about 5 min after fertilization. The [Ca2+]i wave velocity is slowed by increasing the concentration of fura-2 in the cytoplasm to 100 microM, and 250 microM fura-2 blocks wave propagation. The peak [Ca2+]i in a sperm-activated wave is 2.2 +/- 0.1 microM and [Ca2+]i returns to preactivation levels within 21 +/- 0.7 min after fertilization. We further studied the mechanism by which sperm trigger the Ca2+ wave by injecting substances that interfere with Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release or Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). Heparin (3 kDa) inhibits sperm-induced egg activation in a manner that is linearly proportional to its cytoplasmic concentration. At 130 microM (390 micrograms/ml), sperm-induced activation is completely blocked and at 75 microM (225 micrograms/ml) activation of half of the eggs is inhibited. All eggs injected with 130 microM heparin are polyspermic as verified using Hoechst dye to label nuclear DNA. Imaging eggs injected with 75 microM heparin revealed multiple, transient "spots" of increased [Ca2+]i that failed to spread across the egg. Injection of a monoclonal antibody to PIP2 (0.2 microM), kt3g, blocked sperm-induced egg activation in 73% of the 30 eggs injected, suggesting that activation requires the hydrolysis of PIP2 in the membranes of the egg rather than simply the introduction of Ins(1,4,5)P3 from the sperm. This sperm-induced egg activation is not blocked by either of two CICR inhibitors, procaine (10 mM) or ruthenium red (30 microM), and egg activation is not triggered by either of two stimulators of CICR, caffeine (10 mM) or ryanodine (50 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {We explore a computationally efficient method of simulating realistic networks of neurons introduced by Knight, Manin, and Sirovich (1996) in which integrate-and-fire neurons are grouped into large populations of similar neurons. For each population, we form a probability density that represents the distribution of neurons over all possible states. The populations are coupled via stochastic synapses in which the conductance of a neuron is modulated according to the firing rates of its presynaptic populations. The evolution equation for each of these probability densities is a partial differential-integral equation, which we solve numerically. Results obtained for several example networks are tested against conventional computations for groups of individual neurons. We apply this approach to modeling orientation tuning in the visual cortex. Our population density model is based on the recurrent feedback model of a hypercolumn in cat visual cortex of Somers et al. (1995). We simulate the response to oriented flashed bars. As in the Somers model, a weak orientation bias provided by feed-forward lateral geniculate input is transformed by intracortical circuitry into sharper orientation tuning that is independent of stimulus contrast. The population density approach appears to be a viable method for simulating large neural networks. Its computational efficiency overcomes some of the restrictions imposed by computation time in individual neuron simulations, allowing one to build more complex networks and to explore parameter space more easily. The method produces smooth rate functions with one pass of the stimulus and does not require signal averaging. At the same time, this model captures the dynamics of single-neuron activity that are missed in simple firing-rate models.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been suggested to participate in various cellular phenomena triggered by Ca2+ signalling. In the present study, we addressed the functional role of CaMKII in molecular-signal transduction in cells by mathematical modelling of putative biochemical-reaction networks thought to represent an essential part of molecular events responsible for CaMKII-related cellular phenomena. These networks include Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent threonine-286/287 (Thr286/287) autophosphorylation of CaMKII versus dephosphorylation of the enzyme. Computer simulation of the model was performed to examine the relation between the Ca2+-signalling pattern as an input and the resulting degree of Thr286/287 autophosphorylation (m) as an output. Under the simplified condition that the Ca2+ concentration during Ca2+ signalling was set to remain constant with time, the biochemical-reaction networks were shown to function as a switch. There is a threshold for gamma, a parameter representing the probability that the Thr286/287-dephosphorylated CaMKII subunit binds with the Ca2+/calmodulin complex; if gamma is above this threshold, m increases with time to a large degree (switch-on); otherwise, it remains near zero (switch-off). Mathematically, this sharp onset of m at the threshold can be accounted for by a change in the structure of the dynamic system describing the model, from bistability to monostability; this is analogous to the first-order phase transition in statistical physics. For the oscillatory time course of [Ca2+], switching characteristics were also shown with respect to the frequency and the maximum amplitude of the oscillation. These results suggest that graded information mediated by Ca2+ signalling is digitized into all-or-non information mediated by Thr286/287 autophosphorylation of CaMKII.},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R) type III acts as a trigger for InsP(3)-mediated calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling, because this InsP(3) isoform lacks feedback inhibition by cytosolic Ca(2+). We tested this hypothesis in RIN-m5F cells, which express predominantly the type III receptor. Extracellular ATP increases Ca(2+) in these cells, and we found that this effect is independent of extracellular Ca(2+) but is blocked by the InsP(3)R antagonist heparin. There was a dose-dependent increase in the number of cells responding to ATP and two-photon flash photolysis of caged-Ca(2+) heightened the sensitivity of RIN-m5F cells to this increase. These findings provide evidence that Ca(2+) increases the sensitivity of the InsP(3)R type III in intact cells and supports the idea that this isoform can act as a trigger for hormone-induced Ca(2+) signaling.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous, localized intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients (Ca(2+) sparks) in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells are thought to represent Ca(2+) release through ryanodine-receptor (RyR) channels. In porcine tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) cells, ACh induces propagating [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations that also represent Ca(2+) release through RyR channels. We used real-time confocal imaging to examine the spatial and temporal relationships of Ca(2+) sparks to propagating [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in TSM cells. Ca(2+) sparks within an intracellular region displayed different spatial Ca(2+) distributions with every occurrence. The amplitudes of Ca(2+) sparks within a region were approximately integer multiples of the smallest response. However, across different regions, the attributes of Ca(2+) sparks varied considerably. Individual sparks were often grouped together and coupled across adjacent regions. Fusion of individual sparks produced large local elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) that occasionally triggered a propagating [Ca(2+)](i) wave. The incidence of sparks was increased by ryanodine and caffeine but was unaffected by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). Exposure to ACh triggered repetitive, propagating [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations that always originated from foci with a high spark incidence. The [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations disappeared with the removal of ACh, and Ca(2+) sparks reappeared. We conclude that agonist-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations represent a spatial and temporal integration of local Ca(2+)-release events through RyR channels in TSM cells.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that ryanodine and IP3 receptor (RyR/IP3R)-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ signals propagate to the mitochondria, initiating chains of events vital in the regulation of different cellular functions. However, the fraction of released Ca2+ utilized by the mitochondria during these processes has not been quantified. To measure the amount of Ca2+ taken up by the mitochondria, we used a novel approach that involves simultaneous fluorescence imaging of mitochondrial and cytosolic [Ca2+] in permeabilized H9c2 myotubes and RBL-2H3 mast cells. Communication between sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) and mitochondria is maintained in these permeabilized cells, as evidenced by the large RyR/IP3R-driven mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+] and NAD(P)H signals and also by preservation of the morphology of the SR/ER-mitochondrial junctions. Ca2+ was released from the SR/ER by addition of saturating caffeine or IP3 and subsequently thapsigargin (Tg), an inhibitor of SR/ER Ca2+ pumps. The amount of Ca2+ transmitted to the mitochondria was determined by measuring increases of global [Ca2+] in the incubation medium (cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c)). Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was calculated from the difference between [Ca2+]c responses recorded in the absence and presence of uncoupler or from [Ca2+]c elevations evoked by uncoupler or ionophore applied after complete Ca2+ mobilization from the SR/ER. [Ca2+]c increases were calibrated by adding Ca2+ pulses to the permeabilized cells. In H9c2 cells, caffeine induced partial mobilization of SR Ca2+ and mitochondria accumulated 26% of the released Ca2+. Sequential application of caffeine and Tg elicited complete discharge of SR Ca2+ without further increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. In RBL-2H3 mast cells, IP3 by itself elicited complete discharge of the ER Ca2+ store and the increase of the ionophore-releasable mitochondrial Ca2+ content reached 50% of the Ca2+ amount mobilized by IP3 + Tg. Thus, RyR/IP3R direct a substantial fraction of released Ca2+ to the mitochondria.},

@article{pahle2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The topology of signaling cascades has been studied in quite some detail. However, how information is processed exactly is still relatively unknown. Since quite diverse information has to be transported by one and the same signaling cascade (e.g. in case of different agonists), it is clear that the underlying mechanism is more complex than a simple binary switch which relies on the mere presence or absence of a particular species. Therefore, finding means to analyze the information transferred will help in deciphering how information is processed exactly in the cell. Using the information-theoretic measure transfer entropy, we studied the properties of information transfer in an example case, namely calcium signaling under different cellular conditions. Transfer entropy is an asymmetric and dynamic measure of the dependence of two (nonlinear) stochastic processes. We used calcium signaling since it is a well-studied example of complex cellular signaling. It has been suggested that specific information is encoded in the amplitude, frequency and waveform of the oscillatory Ca(2+)-signal.
RESULTS: We set up a computational framework to study information transfer, e.g. for calcium signaling at different levels of activation and different particle numbers in the system. We stochastically coupled simulated and experimentally measured calcium signals to simulated target proteins and used kernel density methods to estimate the transfer entropy from these bivariate time series. We found that, most of the time, the transfer entropy increases with increasing particle numbers. In systems with only few particles, faithful information transfer is hampered by random fluctuations. The transfer entropy also seems to be slightly correlated to the complexity (spiking, bursting or irregular oscillations) of the signal. Finally, we discuss a number of peculiarities of our approach in detail.
CONCLUSION: This study presents the first application of transfer entropy to biochemical signaling pathways. We could quantify the information transferred from simulated/experimentally measured calcium signals to a target enzyme under different cellular conditions. Our approach, comprising stochastic coupling and using the information-theoretic measure transfer entropy, could also be a valuable tool for the analysis of other signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {We construct a mathematical model of the parotid acinar cell with the aim of investigating how the distribution of K(+) and Cl(-) channels affects saliva production. Secretion of fluid is initiated by Ca(2+) signals acting on Ca(2+) dependent K(+) and Cl(-) channels. The opening of these channels facilitates the movement of Cl(-) ions into the lumen which water follows by osmosis. We use recent results into both the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores via the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) and IP(3) dynamics to create a physiologically realistic Ca(2+) model which is able to recreate important experimentally observed behaviours seen in parotid acinar cells. We formulate an equivalent electrical circuit diagram for the movement of ions responsible for water flow which enables us to calculate and include distinct apical and basal membrane potentials to the model. We show that maximum saliva production occurs when a small amount of K(+) conductance is located at the apical membrane, with the majority in the basal membrane. The maximum fluid output is found to coincide with a minimum in the apical membrane potential. The traditional model whereby all Cl(-) channels are located in the apical membrane is shown to be the most efficient Cl(-) channel distribution.},

We offer a comprehensive model of presynaptic processes, encompassing mobilization of reserve vesicles, priming of docked vesicles, their association with Ca(2+) channels, and refractoriness of release sites, while accounting for data on presynaptic buffers governing Ca(2+) diffusion.

	Abstract = {In electrically nonexcitable cells, Ca(2+) influx is essential for regulating a host of kinetically distinct processes involving exocytosis, enzyme control, gene regulation, cell growth and proliferation, and apoptosis. The major Ca(2+) entry pathway in these cells is the store-operated one, in which the emptying of intracellular Ca(2+) stores activates Ca(2+) influx (store-operated Ca(2+) entry, or capacitative Ca(2+) entry). Several biophysically distinct store-operated currents have been reported, but the best characterized is the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current, I(CRAC). Although it was initially considered to function only in nonexcitable cells, growing evidence now points towards a central role for I(CRAC)-like currents in excitable cells too. In spite of intense research, the signal that relays the store Ca(2+) content to CRAC channels in the plasma membrane, as well as the molecular identity of the Ca(2+) sensor within the stores, remains elusive. Resolution of these issues would be greatly helped by the identification of the CRAC channel gene. In some systems, evidence suggests that store-operated channels might be related to TRP homologs, although no consensus has yet been reached. Better understood are mechanisms that inactivate store-operated entry and hence control the overall duration of Ca(2+) entry. Recent work has revealed a central role for mitochondria in the regulation of I(CRAC), and this is particularly prominent under physiological conditions. I(CRAC) therefore represents a dynamic interplay between endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and plasma membrane. In this review, we describe the key electrophysiological features of I(CRAC) and other store-operated Ca(2+) currents and how they are regulated, and we consider recent advances that have shed insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in this ubiquitous and vital Ca(2+) entry pathway.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Calcium puffs are localized Ca2+ signals mediated by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through clusters of inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) channels. The recruitment of \{IP3R\} channels during puffs depends on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, a regenerative process that must be terminated to maintain control of cell signaling and prevent Ca2+ cytotoxicity. Here, we studied puff termination using total internal reflection microscopy to resolve the gating of individual \{IP3R\} channels during puffs in intact SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We find that the kinetics of \{IP3R\} channel closing differ from that expected for independent, stochastic gating, in that multiple channels tend to remain open together longer than predicted from their individual open lifetimes and then close in near-synchrony. This behavior cannot readily be explained by previously proposed termination mechanisms, including Ca2+-inhibition of \{IP3Rs\} and local depletion of Ca2+ in the \{ER\} lumen.

	Abstract = {Astrocytes in the rat thalamus display spontaneous [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations that are due to intracellular release, but are not dependent on neuronal activity. In this study we have investigated the mechanisms involved in these spontaneous [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations using slices loaded with Fluo-4 AM (5 microM) and confocal microscopy. Bafilomycin A1 incubation had no effect on the number of spontaneous [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations indicating that they were not dependent on vesicular neurotransmitter release. Oscillations were also unaffected by ryanodine. Phospholipase C (PLC) inhibition decreased the number of astrocytes responding to metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation but did not reduce the number of spontaneously active astrocytes, indicating that [Ca(2+)](i) increases are not due to membrane-coupled PLC activation. Spontaneous [Ca(2+)](i) increases were abolished by an IP3 receptor antagonist, whilst the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine chloride prolonged their duration, indicating a role for PKC and inositol 1,4,5,-triphosphate receptor activation. BayK8644 increased the number of astrocytes exhibiting [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations, and prolonged the responses to mGluR activation, indicating a possible effect on store-operated Ca(2+) entry. Increasing [Ca(2+)](o) increased the number of spontaneously active astrocytes and the number of transients exhibited by each astrocyte. Inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase by cyclopiazonic acid also induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients in astrocytes indicating a role for cytoplasmic Ca(2+) in the induction of spontaneous oscillations. Incubation with 20 microM Fluo-4 reduced the number of astrocytes exhibiting spontaneous increases. This study indicates that Ca(2+) has a role in triggering Ca(2+) release from an inositol 1,4,5,-triphosphate sensitive store in astrocytes during the generation of spontaneous [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model of arterial vasomotion in which irregular rhythmic activity is generated by the nonlinear interaction of intracellular and membrane oscillators that depend on cyclic release of Ca2+ from internal stores and cyclic influx of extracellular Ca2+, respectively. Four key control variables were selected on the basis of the pharmacological characteristics of histamine-induced vasomotion in rabbit ear arteries: Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol, Ca2+ concentration in ryanodine-sensitive stores, cell membrane potential, and the open state probability of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Although not represented by independent dynamic variables, the model also incorporates Na+/Ca2+ exchange, the Na+-K+-ATPase, Cl- fluxes, and Ca2+ efflux via the extrusion ATPase. Simulations reproduce a wide spectrum of experimental observations, including 1) the effects of interventions that modulate the functionality of Ca2+ stores and membrane ion channels, 2) paradoxes such as the apparently unpredictable dual action of Ca2+ antagonists and low extracellular Na+ concentration, which can abolish vasomotion or promote the appearance of large-amplitude oscillations, and 3) period-doubling, quasiperiodic, and intermittent routes to chaos. Nonlinearity is essential to explain these diverse patterns of experimental vascular response.},

Interactions between ryanodine- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca(2+) stores and transmembrane ion fluxes via K(+) channels, Cl(-) channels, and voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels were studied by comparing simulations of oscillatory behavior with experimental measurements of membrane potential, intracellular free [Ca(2+)] and vessel diameter during a range of pharmacological interventions.

	Abstract = {Xenopus laevis oocytes (stages V and VI) are a widely used model system for the study of Ca2+ signaling. The properties of the Xenopus oocyte InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) are of paramount importance for our thinking about this system and for our efforts to model Ca2+ dynamics in the oocyte cytosol. The recent data regarding the molecular structure, the regulation and the functional properties of the Xenopus oocyte InsP3R are summarized in this review. The main properties of the Xenopus oocyte InsP3R are compared with the properties of the cerebellar InsP3R and are shown to be remarkably similar. The density of the InsP3R in Xenopus oocyte cytoplasm is estimated to a value between 1.1-4.1 x 10(14) tetrameric InsP3R/l. The use of these numbers in a quantitative model of Ca2+ wave propagation leads to values of Ca2+ wave amplitude (0.8-1.5 microM Ca2+) and velocity of the wave propagation (12-24 microns/s) that are in excellent agreement with the values observed experimentally. The density of InsP3Rs in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum is estimated to be about 20,000-fold higher, but in other types of neurons and in peripheral tissues the InsP3R density is estimated to be of the same order of magnitude as, or up to 20-fold higher than, in Xenopus oocytes. The implications of differences in InsP3R density for Ca2+ signaling are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Activation of cells by many extracellular agonists leads to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃). IP₃ is a global messenger that easily diffuses in the cytosol. Its receptor (IP₃R) is a Ca(2+)-release channel located on intracellular membranes, especially the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The IP₃R has an affinity for IP(3) in the low nanomolar range. A prime regulator of the IP₃R is the Ca(2+) ion itself. Cytosolic Ca(2+) is considered as a co-agonist of the IP₃R, as it strongly increases IP(3)R activity at concentrations up to about 300 nM. In contrast, at higher concentrations, cytosolic Ca(2+) inhibits the IP₃R. Also the luminal Ca(2+) sensitizes the IP₃R. In higher organisms three genes encode for an IP₃R and additional diversity exists as a result of alternative splicing mechanisms and the formation of homo- and heterotetramers. The various IP₃R isoforms have a similar structure and a similar function, but due to differences in their affinity for IP₃, their variable sensitivity to regulatory parameters, their differential interaction with associated proteins, and the variation in their subcellular localization, they participate differently in the formation of intracellular Ca(2+) signals and this affects therefore the physiological consequences of these signals.},

@article{patel1999,
	Abstract = {The receptors for the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) constitute a family of Ca2+ channels responsible for the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Three different gene products (types I-III) have been isolated, encoding polypeptides which assemble as large tetrameric structures. Recent molecular studies have advanced our knowledge about the structure, regulation and function of IP3 receptors. For example, several Ca(2+)-binding sites and a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-binding domain have been mapped within the type I IP3 receptor, and studies on purified cerebellar IP3 receptors propose a second Ca(2+)-independent calmodulin-binding domain. In addition, minimal requirements for the binding of immunophilins and the formation of tetramers have been identified. Overexpression of IP3 receptors has provided further clues to the regulation of individual IP3 receptor isoforms present within cells, and the role that they play in the generation of IP3-dependent Ca2+ signals. Inhibition of IP3 receptor function and expression, and analysis of mutant IP3 receptors, suggests that IP3 receptors are involved in such diverse cellular processes as proliferation and apoptosis and are thus, necessary for normal development. Our understanding of the complex spatial and temporal nature of cytosolic Ca2+ increases and the role that these Ca2+ signals play in cell function depend upon our knowledge of the structure and the regulation of IP3 receptors. This review focuses on the molecular properties of these ubiquitous intracellular Ca2+ channels.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial calcium accumulation was recently shown to depend on a complex composed of an inner-membrane channel (MCU and MCUb) and regulatory subunits (MICU1, MCUR1, and EMRE). A fundamental property of MCU is low activity at resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations, preventing deleterious Ca(2+) cycling and organelle overload. Here we demonstrate that these properties are ensured by a regulatory heterodimer composed of two proteins with opposite effects, MICU1 and MICU2, which, both in purified lipid bilayers and in intact cells, stimulate and inhibit MCU activity, respectively. Both MICU1 and MICU2 are regulated by calcium through their EF-hand domains, thus accounting for the sigmoidal response of MCU to [Ca(2+)] in situ and allowing tight physiological control. At low [Ca(2+)], the dominant effect of MICU2 largely shuts down MCU activity; at higher [Ca(2+)], the stimulatory effect of MICU1 allows the prompt response of mitochondria to Ca(2+) signals generated in the cytoplasm.},

	Abstract = {Many models have been developed to account for stimulus-evoked [Ca(2+)] responses, but few address how responses elicited in specific cell types are defined by the Ca(2+) transport and buffering systems that operate in the same cells. In this study, we extend previous modeling studies by linking the time course of stimulus-evoked [Ca(2+)] responses to the underlying Ca(2+) transport and buffering systems. Depolarization-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) responses were studied in sympathetic neurons under voltage clamp, asking how response kinetics are defined by the Ca(2+) handling systems expressed in these cells. We investigated five cases of increasing complexity, comparing observed and calculated responses deduced from measured Ca(2+) handling properties. In Case 1, [Ca(2+)](i) responses were elicited by small Ca(2+) currents while Ca(2+) transport by internal stores was inhibited, leaving plasma membrane Ca(2+) extrusion intact. In Case 2, responses to the same stimuli were measured while mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake was active. In Case 3, responses were elicited as in Case 2 but with larger Ca(2+) currents that produce larger and faster [Ca(2+)](i) elevations. Case 4 included the mitochondrial Na/Ca exchanger. Finally, Case 5 included ER Ca(2+) uptake and release pathways. We found that [Ca(2+)](i) responses elicited by weak stimuli (Cases 1 and 2) could be quantitatively reconstructed using a spatially uniform model incorporating the measured properties of Ca(2+) entry, removal, and buffering. Responses to strong depolarization (Case 3) could not be described by this model, but were consistent with a diffusion model incorporating the same Ca(2+) transport and buffering descriptions, as long as endogenous buffers have low mobility, leading to steep radial [Ca(2+)](i) gradients and spatially nonuniform Ca(2+) loading by mitochondria. When extended to include mitochondrial Ca(2+) release (Case 4) and ER Ca(2+) transport (Case 5), the diffusion model could also account for previous measurements of stimulus-evoked changes in total mitochondrial and ER Ca concentration.},

	Abstract = {The response of smooth muscle cells to changes in blood pressure is a large component of the processes that regulate blood flow. Models of the mechanical behaviour of smooth muscle cells normally assume that the mechanical properties of the cell are dependent upon the state of attached myosin, this being determined by a four state kinetic model. An analysis of the behaviour of this kinetic model is presented here, in particular the response to oscillations in intracellular calcium. It is shown that the amplitudes of oscillation of the states in the kinetic model drop off rapidly with frequency and that at 1 Hz are of negligible magnitude. This is found to be true for a number of different combinations of model parameters, indicating that at the cardiac driving frequency the smooth muscle cell response is solely determined by the mechanical behaviour of the cells, without any influence of the biochemical processes, i.e. the response is purely passive.},

	Abstract = {Insulin secretion is biphasic in response to a step in glucose stimulation. Recent experiments suggest that 2 different mechanisms operate during the 2 phases, with transient first-phase secretion due to exocytosis of docked granules but the second sustained phase due largely to newcomer granules. Another line of research has shown that there exist 2 pools of releasable granules with different Ca(2+) sensitivities. An immediately releasable pool (IRP) is located in the vicinity of Ca(2+) channels, whereas a highly Ca(2+)-sensitive pool (HCSP) resides mainly away from Ca(2+) channels. We extend a previous model of exocytosis and insulin release by adding an HCSP and show that the inclusion of this pool naturally leads to insulin secretion mainly from newcomer granules during the second phase of secretion. We show that the model is compatible with data from single cells on the HCSP and from stimulation of islets by glucose, including L- and R-type Ca(2+) channel knockouts, as well as from Syntaxin-1A-deficient cells. We also use the model to investigate the relative contribution of calcium signaling and pool depletion in controlling biphasic secretion.},

	Abstract = {Electrical activity in pancreatic β-cells plays a pivotal role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by coupling metabolism to calcium-triggered exocytosis. Mathematical models based on rodent data have helped in understanding the mechanisms underlying the electrophysiological patterns observed in laboratory animals. However, human β-cells differ in several aspects, and in particular in their electrophysiological characteristics, from rodent β-cells. Hence, from a clinical perspective and to obtain insight into the defects in insulin secretion relevant for diabetes mellitus, it is important to study human β-cells. This work presents the first mathematical model of electrical activity based entirely on published ion channel characteristics of human β-cells. The model reproduces satisfactorily a series of experimentally observed patterns in human β-cells, such as spiking and rapid bursting electrical activity, and their response to a range of ion channel antagonists.

	Abstract = {Acidic organelles form an important intracellular Ca(2+) pool that can drive global Ca(2+) signals through coupling with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores. Recently identified lysosome-ER membrane contact sites might allow formation of Ca(2+) microdomains, although their size renders observation of Ca(2+) dynamics impractical. Here, we generated a computational model of lysosome-ER coupling that incorporated a previous model of the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor as the ER Ca(2+) 'amplifier' and lysosomal leaks as the Ca(2+) 'trigger'. The model qualitatively described global Ca(2+) responses to the lysosomotropic agent GPN, which caused a controlled but substantial depletion of small solutes from the lysosome. Adapting this model to physiological lysosomal leaks induced by the Ca(2+) mobilising messenger NAADP demonstrated that lysosome-ER microdomains are capable of driving global Ca(2+) oscillations. Interestingly, our simulations suggest that the microdomain [Ca(2+)] need not be higher than that in the cytosol for responses to occur, thus matching the relatively high affinity of IP3 receptors for Ca(2+). The relative distribution and overall density of the lysosomal leaks dictated whether microdomains triggered or modulated global signals. Our data provide a computational framework for probing lysosome-ER Ca(2+) dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Calcium has been established as a key messenger in both intra- and intercellular signaling. Experimentally observed intracellular calcium responses to different agonists show a variety of behaviors from simple spiking to complex oscillatory regimes. Here we study typical experimental traces of calcium oscillations in hepatocytes obtained in response to phenylephrine and ATP. The traces were analyzed with methods of nonlinear time series analysis in order to determine the stochastic/deterministic nature of the intracellular calcium oscillations. Despite the fact that the oscillations appear, visually, to be deterministic yet perturbed by noise, our analyses provide strong evidence that the measured calcium traces in hepatocytes are prevalently of stochastic nature. In particular, bursting calcium oscillations are temporally correlated Gaussian series distorted by a monotonic, instantaneous, time-independent function, whilst the spiking behavior appears to have a dynamical nonlinear component whereby the overall determinism level is still low. The biological importance of this finding is discussed in relation to the mechanisms incorporated in mathematical models as well as the role of stochasticity and determinism at cellular and tissue levels which resemble typical statistical and thermodynamic effects in physics.},

	Abstract = {Increased resistance of airways or blood vessels within the lung is associated with asthma or pulmonary hypertension and results from contraction of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). To study the mechanisms regulating these contractions, we developed a mouse lung slice preparation containing bronchioles and arterioles and used phase-contrast and confocal microscopy to correlate the contractile responses with changes in [Ca(2+)](i) of the SMCs. The airways are the focus of this study. The agonists, 5-hydroxytrypamine (5-HT) and acetylcholine (ACH) induced a concentration-dependent contraction of the airways. High concentrations of KCl induced twitching of the airway SMCs but had little effect on airway size. 5-HT and ACH induced asynchronous oscillations in [Ca(2+)](i) that propagated as Ca(2+) waves within the airway SMCs. The frequency of the Ca(2+) oscillations was dependent on the agonist concentration and correlated with the extent of sustained airway contraction. In the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) or in the presence of Ni(2+), the frequency of the Ca(2+) oscillations declined and the airway relaxed. By contrast, KCl induced low frequency Ca(2+) oscillations that were associated with SMC twitching. Each KCl-induced Ca(2+) oscillation consisted of a large Ca(2+) wave that was preceded by multiple localized Ca(2+) transients. KCl-induced responses were resistant to neurotransmitter blockers but were abolished by Ni(2+) or nifedipine and the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). Caffeine abolished the contractile effects of 5-HT, ACH, and KCl. These results indicate that (a) 5-HT and ACH induce airway SMC contraction by initiating Ca(2+) oscillations, (b) KCl induces Ca(2+) transients and twitching by overloading and releasing Ca(2+) from intracellular stores, (c) a sustained, Ni(2+)-sensitive, influx of Ca(2+) mediates the refilling of stores to maintain Ca(2+) oscillations and, in turn, SMC contraction, and (d) the magnitude of sustained airway SMC contraction is regulated by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Increased resistance of the small blood vessels within the lungs is associated with pulmonary hypertension and results from a decrease in size induced by the contraction of their smooth muscle cells (SMCs). To study the mechanisms that regulate the contraction of intrapulmonary arteriole SMCs, the contractile and Ca(2+) responses of the arteriole SMCs to 5-hydroxytrypamine (5-HT) and KCl were observed with phase-contrast and scanning confocal microscopy in thin lung slices cut from mouse lungs stiffened with agarose and gelatin. 5-HT induced a concentration-dependent contraction of the arterioles. Increasing concentrations of extracellular KCl induced transient contractions in the SMCs and a reduction in the arteriole luminal size. 5-HT induced oscillations in [Ca(2+)](i) within the SMCs, and the frequency of these Ca(2+) oscillations was dependent on the agonist concentration and correlated with the extent of sustained arteriole contraction. By contrast, KCl induced Ca(2+) oscillations that occurred with low frequencies and were preceded by small, localized transient Ca(2+) events. The 5-HT-induced Ca(2+) oscillations and contractions occurred in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) and were resistant to Ni(2+) and nifedipine but were abolished by caffeine. KCl-induced Ca(2+) oscillations and contractions were abolished by the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) and the presence of Ni(2+), nifedipine, and caffeine. Arteriole contraction was induced or abolished by a 5-HT(2)-specific agonist or antagonist, respectively. These results indicate that 5-HT, acting via 5-HT(2) receptors, induces arteriole contraction by initiating Ca(2+) oscillations and that KCl induces contraction via Ca(2+) transients resulting from the overfilling of internal Ca(2+) stores. We hypothesize that the magnitude of the sustained intrapulmonary SMC contraction is determined by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations and also by the relaxation rate of the SMC.},

	Abstract = {We present a model for predicting the temporal and spatial dependence of [Ca] in the cardiac subsarcolemmal diadic region (cleft), following Ca release from the "feet" of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This region is modeled as a disc 10 nm thick, 430 nm in radius, with or without Ca binding sites and open at its periphery to the cytosol. [Ca] is computed for three diffusion coefficients (100, 20 and 4% of aqueous diffusion), following release of a 20-msec square pulse sufficient to produce 50% maximal contractile force, or repetitive release (400/min) of such pulses. Numerical solutions are obtained for the general diffusion/binding problem and analytic solutions for the case of no binding sites. For the middle value of diffusion coefficient, and in the absence of binding sites, [Ca] rises to approximately 1.5 mM in 20-msec and then falls to approximately 0.1 microM in less than 3 msec. Adding binding sites reduces peak [Ca] to approximately 0.6 mM but prolongs its decline, requiring approximately 200 msec to reach 20 microM. For repetitive release [Ca] is greater than 100 microM for roughly half of each cycle. Two major implications of the predicted [Ca] are: (i) The effect of Ca binding sites on [Ca] will cause Ca efflux from the cleft via the Na-Ca exchanger (Km(Ca) approximately 20 microM) to continue at a significant level for greater than 200 msec. (ii) The time constant for inactivation of release from the "feet" must be much greater than for activation if Ca-induced Ca release is to continue for greater than 1-2 msec.},

	Abstract = {This paper extends the model for Ca movement in the cardiac ventricular cell from the diadic cleft space to the entire sarcomere. The model predicts the following: 1) Shortly after SR release there is a [Ca] gradient >3 orders of magnitude from cleft center to M-line which, 50 ms after release, is still >30. Outside the cleft, 40 ms after cessation of release, the axial gradient from Z to M-line is >3. 2) At the end of SR release, >50% of the total Ca released is bound to low-affinity inner sarcolemmal phospholipid binding sites within the cleft. 3) Halving the SR release almost doubles the fraction of release removed from the cell via Na/Ca exchange and reduces average sarcomeric free [Ca] by 70%. 4) Adding 100 microM fluo-3, which doubles the buffering capacity of the cytoplasm, reduces peak average sarcomeric [Ca] by >50% and increases the initial half-time for [Ca] decrease by approximately twofold. 5) A typical Ca "spark" can be generated by an SR release 20% of maximum (4 x 10(-20) moles) over 2 ms. Fluo-3 (100 microM) significantly "shrinks" the spark. 6) The "spark" is a consequence of elementary events within the diadic cleft space. For example, removal of cleft binding sites would cause average sarcomeric Ca to increase by >10 fold, fall 10 times more rapidly, decrease latency for appearance of the spark by >20 times, and reduce spark duration by 85%. 7) Dividing SR Ca release between cleft and corbular SR produces a secondary [Ca] peak and a "flattening" of the sarcomeric [Ca] transient. These changes probably could not be resolved with current confocal microscopic techniques.},

	Abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) form major intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are large tetrameric ion channels in the SR and ER membranes that can release Ca(2+) upon triggering. With molecular masses exceeding 2.2MDa, they represent the pinnacle of ion channel complexity. RyRs have adopted long-range allosteric mechanisms, with pore opening resulting in conformational changes over 200{\AA} away. Together with tens of protein and small molecule modulators, RyRs have adopted rich and complex regulatory mechanisms. Structurally related to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), RyRs have been studied extensively using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Along with more recent X-ray crystallographic analyses of individual domains, these have resulted in pseudo-atomic models. Over 500 mutations in RyRs have been linked to severe genetic disorders, which underscore their role in the contraction of cardiac and skeletal muscles. Most of these have been linked to gain-of-function phenotypes, resulting in premature or prolonged leak of Ca(2+) in the cytosol. This review outlines our current knowledge on the structure of RyRs at high and low resolutions, their relationship to IP3Rs, an overview of the most commonly studied regulatory mechanisms, and models that relate disease-causing mutations to altered channel function.},

In these tissues, Ca(2+) signalling is crucially important for the control of both fluid secretion and electrolyte secretion as well as the regulation of macromolecule secretion. In this overview article, I shall attempt to give some general background to the concepts underlying our current thinking about Ca(2+) signalling in epithelia and its roles in regulating secretion. It is outside the scope of this review to provide a comprehensive account of Ca(2+) signalling and the many different processes in the many different secretory epithelia that are controlled by Ca(2+) signals. It is my aim to draw attention to some general features of Ca(2+) signalling processes in secretory epithelia, which are rather different from those in, for example, endocrine glands. The principal examples will be taken from studies of exocrine cells and, in particular, pancreatic acinar cells, as they are the pioneer cells with regard to investigations of Ca(2+) signalling due to primary intracellular Ca(2+) release. They also represent the cell type which has been characterized in most detail with regard to Ca(2+) transport events and mechanisms.},

Like any other GPCRs, class-C receptors possess a heptahelical domain (HD) involved in heterotrimeric G-protein activation, but most of them also have a large extracellular domain (ECD) responsible for agonist recognition and binding. In addition, it is now well accepted that these receptors are dimers, either homo or heterodimers. This complex architecture raises a number of important questions. Here we will discuss our view of how agonist binding within the large ECD triggers the necessary change of conformation, or stabilize a specific conformation, of the heptahelical domain leading to G-protein activation. How ligands acting within the heptahelical domain can change the properties of these complex macromolecules.},

Little is known about the Golgi apparatus, despite the fact that Ca2+ within its lumen controls essential processes, such as protein processing and sorting. We report the direct monitoring of the [Ca2+] in the Golgi lumen ([Ca2+]Golgi) of living HeLa cells, using a specifically targeted Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein. With this probe, we show that, in resting cells, [Ca2+]Golgi is approximately 0.3 mM and that Ca2+ accumulation by the Golgi has properties distinct from those of the endoplasmic reticulum (as inferred by the sensitivity to specific inhibitors). Upon stimulation with histamine, an agonist coupled to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a large, rapid decrease in [Ca2+]Golgi is observed. The Golgi apparatus can thus be regarded as a bona fide IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store, a notion with major implications for the control of organelle function, as well as for the generation of local cytosolic Ca2+ signals.},

	Abstract = {The Golgi apparatus plays a central role in lipid and protein post-translational modification and sorting. Morphologically the organelle is heterogeneous and it is possible to distinguish stacks of flat cysternae (cis- and medial Golgi), tubular-reticular networks and vesicles (trans-Golgi). These morphological differences parallel a distinct functionality with a selective distribution and complementary roles of the enzymes found in the different compartments. The Golgi apparatus has been also shown to be involved in Ca(2+) signalling: it is indeed endowed with Ca(2+) pumps, Ca(2+) release channels and Ca(2+) binding proteins and is thought to participate in determining the spatio-temporal complexity of the Ca(2+) signal within the cell, though this role is still poorly understood. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the organelle is heterogeneous in terms of Ca(2+) handling and selective reduction of Ca(2+) concentration, both in vitro and in a genetic human disease, within one of its sub-compartment results in alterations of protein trafficking within the secretory pathway and of the entire Golgi morphology. In this paper we review the available information on the Ca(2+) toolkit within the Golgi, its heterogeneous distribution in the organelle sub-compartments and discuss the implications of these characteristics for the physiopathology of the Golgi apparatus.},

@article{plant1988,
	Abstract = {1. Ca2+ currents were recorded using the whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique from mouse pancreatic B-cells kept in culture for 1-4 days. B-cells were identified in the cell-attached mode by their response to a change in the glucose concentration from 3 to 15 or 20 mM or by their inward currents. 2. Only one component of Ca2+ current was observed in these cells, which activated at potentials greater than -50 mV and was blocked by nitrendipine (5 microM), and increased in amplitude by CGP 28392 (5 microM). 3. During maintained depolarizations the Ca2+ current inactivated considerably but not completely. Inactivation was most marked at potentials where the Ca2+ currents were large, but in general was slower for currents at potentials greater than 0 mV than at more negative potentials. 4. Two-pulse experiments showed that the inactivation curve for the Ca2+ current was U-shaped, returning to unity at potentials approaching the Ca2+ equilibrium potential. Measurements of Ca2+ entry showed that inactivation was dependent on the amount of Ca2+ entering during the pre-pulse, independent of the pre-pulse potential. 5. Ca2+ currents were not appreciably slowed when BAPTA, a faster buffer of Ca2+, replaced EGTA in the pipette solution. 6. Replacement of Ca2+ in the external solution by Ba2+ increased the amplitude of the inward current and largely abolished inactivation. Large inward currents through Ca2+ channels were observed in the absence of divalent cations in the external solution (+EGTA), which were presumably carried by Na+. These currents did not inactivate during 150 ms depolarizations, but were increased in amplitude by CGP 28392 (5 microM) and blocked by D600 (30 microM). 7. The observations suggest that normal mouse pancreatic B-cells have only one type of Ca2+ channel which is dihydropyridine sensitive and inactivates by a mechanism which is almost purely Ca2+ dependent. Inactivation of the Ca2+ current will probably be important in the control of Ca2+ entry during glucose-induced electrical activity.},

@article{politi2006,
	Abstract = {Hormones that act through the calcium-releasing messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), cause intracellular calcium oscillations, which have been ascribed to calcium feedbacks on the IP3 receptor. Recent studies have shown that IP3 levels oscillate together with the cytoplasmic calcium concentration. To investigate the functional significance of this phenomenon, we have developed mathematical models of the interaction of both second messengers. The models account for both positive and negative feedbacks of calcium on IP3 metabolism, mediated by calcium activation of phospholipase C and IP3 3-kinase, respectively. The coupled IP3 and calcium oscillations have a greatly expanded frequency range compared to calcium fluctuations obtained with clamped IP3. Therefore the feedbacks can be physiologically important in supporting the efficient frequency encoding of hormone concentration observed in many cell types. This action of the feedbacks depends on the turnover rate of IP3. To shape the oscillations, positive feedback requires fast IP3 turnover, whereas negative feedback requires slow IP3 turnover. The ectopic expression of an IP3 binding protein has been used to decrease the rate of IP3 turnover experimentally, resulting in a dose-dependent slowing and eventual quenching of the Ca2+ oscillations. These results are consistent with a model based on positive feedback of Ca2+ on IP3 production.},

@article{pozo2002,
	Abstract = {We sought to elucidate the regulation of gallbladder smooth muscle (GBSM) excitability by localized Ca(2+) release events (sparks) and large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent (BK) channels by determining whether sparks exist in GBSM and, if so, whether they activate BK channels. Sparks were identified in isolated GBSM loaded with fluo 4. Each spark was associated with a transient outward current, suggesting communication of ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels with BK channels. This was confirmed by the inhibition of outward currents with iberiotoxin (100 nM), thapsigargin (200 nM), and ryanodine (10 microM). In current clamp mode, the transient BK currents were associated with brief membrane hyperpolarizations (10.9 +/- 1.3 mV). Because transient BK currents could dampen GBSM excitability, we tested whether CCK attenuates these events. CCK (10 nM) reduced the amplitude and frequency of transient BK currents, and subsequent caffeine application restored transient BK current activity. These results support the concept that RyRs and BK channels contribute to the regulation of GBSM excitability and that CCK can act in part by inhibiting this pathway.},

	Abstract = {This study evaluated the relationship between regional elevation in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by acetylcholine (ACh) and the global cellular responses in porcine tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) cells. Regional (approximately 1.5 microm3) and global (whole cell) changes in [Ca2+]i were measured in fluo-3 loaded TSM cells using real-time confocal microscopy. Regional responses appeared as propagating [Ca2+]i oscillations whereas global responses reflected the spatiotemporal integration of these regional responses. Within a region, [Ca2+]i oscillations were 'biphasic' with initial higher frequencies, followed by slower steady-state oscillations. With increasing ACh concentration, the peak (maximum value relative to 0 nM) of regional [Ca2+]i oscillations remained relatively constant, whereas both frequency and propagation velocity increased. In contrast, the global spatiotemporal integration of the regional oscillatory responses appeared as a concentration-dependent increase in peak as well as mean cellular [Ca2+]i. We conclude that the significance of ACh-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations lies in the establishment of mean [Ca2+]i level for slower Ca2+-dependent physiological processes via modulation of oscillation frequency and propagation velocity.},

In eukaryotic cells, Ca(2+) storage is achieved within specific intracellular organelles, especially the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum, in which Ca(2+) is buffered by specific proteins known as Ca(2+) buffers. Ca(2+) buffers are a diverse group of proteins, varying in their affinities and capacities for Ca(2+), but they typically also carry out other functions within the cell. The wide range of organelles containing Ca(2+) and the evidence supporting cross-talk between these organelles suggest the existence of a dynamic network of organellar Ca(2+) signaling, mediated by a variety of organellar Ca(2+) buffers.},

@article{puglisi2001,
	Abstract = {An interactive computer program, LabHEART, was developed to simulate the action potential (AP), ionic currents, and Ca handling mechanisms in a rabbit ventricular myocyte. User-oriented, its design allows switching between voltage and current clamp and easy on-line manipulation of key parameters to change the original formulation. The model reproduces normal rabbit ventricular myocyte currents, Ca transients, and APs. We also changed parameters to simulate data from heart failure (HF) myocytes, including reduced transient outward (I(to)) and inward rectifying K currents (I(K1)), enhanced Na/Ca exchange expression, and reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase function, but unaltered Ca current density. These changes caused reduced Ca transient amplitude and increased AP duration (especially at lower frequency) as observed experimentally. The model shows that the increased Na/Ca exchange current (I(NaCa)) in HF lowers the intracellular [Ca] threshold for a triggered AP from 800 to 540 nM. Similarly, the decrease in I(K1) reduces the threshold to 600 nM. Changes in I(to) have no effect. Combining enhanced Na/Ca exchange with reduced I(K1) (as in HF) lowers the threshold to trigger an AP to 380 nM. These changes reproduce experimental results in HF, where the contributions of different factors are not readily distinguishable. We conclude that the triggered APs that contribute to nonreentrant ventricular tachycardia in HF are due approximately equally (and nearly additively) to alterations in I(NaCa) and I(K1).

	Abstract = {Computer modeling of cardiac myocytes has flourished in recent years. Models have evolved from mathematical descriptions of ionic channels alone to more sophisticated formulations that include calcium transport mechanisms, ATP production and metabolic pathways. The increased complexity is fueled by the new data available in the field. The continuous production of experimental data has led to the evolution of increasingly refined descriptions of the phenomena by modelers. Integrating the numerous systems involved in cardiac myocyte homeostasis makes the use of computer models necessary due to the unreliability of intuitive approaches. However the complexity of the model should not imply a cumbersome operation of the program. As with any tool, computer models have to be easy to operate or their strength will be diminished and potential users will not benefit fully from them. The contribution of the computer modeler to their respective biological fields will be more successful and enduring if modelers devote sufficient time to implement their equations into a model with user-friendly characteristics.},

	Abstract = {The luminal Ca2+ regulation of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) was explored at the single channel level. The luminal Ca2+ and Mg2+ sensitivity of single CSQ2-stripped and CSQ2-associated RyR2 channels was defined. Action of wild-type CSQ2 and of two mutant CSQ2s (R33Q and L167H) was also compared. Two luminal Ca2+ regulatory mechanism(s) were identified. One is a RyR2-resident mechanism that is CSQ2 independent and does not distinguish between luminal Ca2+ and Mg2+. This mechanism modulates the maximal efficacy of cytosolic Ca2+ activation. The second luminal Ca2+ regulatory mechanism is CSQ2 dependent and distinguishes between luminal Ca2+ and Mg2+. It does not depend on CSQ2 oligomerization or CSQ2 monomer Ca2+ binding affinity. The key Ca2+-sensitive step in this mechanism may be the Ca2+-dependent CSQ2 interaction with triadin. The CSQ2-dependent mechanism alters the cytosolic Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel. The R33Q CSQ2 mutant can participate in luminal RyR2 Ca2+ regulation but less effectively than wild-type (WT) CSQ2. CSQ2-L167H does not participate in luminal RyR2 Ca2+ regulation. The disparate actions of these two catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)-linked mutants implies that either alteration or elimination of CSQ2-dependent luminal RyR2 regulation can generate the CPVT phenotype. We propose that the RyR2-resident, CSQ2-independent luminal Ca2+ mechanism may assure that all channels respond robustly to large (>5 muM) local cytosolic Ca2+ stimuli, whereas the CSQ2-dependent mechanism may help close RyR2 channels after luminal Ca2+ falls below approximately 0.5 mM.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied how glucose and ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel modulators affect alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: GYY mice (expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein in alpha-cells) and NMRI mice were used. [Ca(2+)](c), the K(ATP) current (I(KATP), perforated mode) and cell metabolism [NAD(P)H fluorescence] were monitored in single alpha-cells and, for comparison, in single beta-cells.
RESULTS: In 0.5 mmol/l glucose, [Ca(2+)](c) oscillated in some alpha-cells and was basal in the others. Increasing glucose to 15 mmol/l decreased [Ca(2+)](c) by approximately 30% in oscillating cells and was ineffective in the others. alpha-Cell I(KATP) was inhibited by tolbutamide and activated by diazoxide or the mitochondrial poison azide, as in beta-cells. Tolbutamide increased alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c), whereas diazoxide and azide abolished [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations. Increasing glucose from 0.5 to 15 mmol/l did not change I(KATP) and NAD(P)H fluorescence in alpha-cells in contrast to beta-cells. The use of nimodipine showed that L-type Ca(2+) channels are the main conduits for Ca(2+) influx in alpha-cells. gamma-Aminobutyric acid and zinc did not decrease alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c), and insulin, although lowering [Ca(2+)](c) very modestly, did not affect glucagon secretion.
CONCLUSIONS: alpha-Cells display similarities with beta-cells: K(ATP) channels control Ca(2+) influx mainly through L-type Ca(2+) channels. However, alpha-cells have distinct features from beta-cells: Most K(ATP) channels are already closed at low glucose, glucose does not affect cell metabolism and I(KATP), and it slightly decreases [Ca(2+)](c). Hence, glucose and K(ATP) channel modulators exert distinct effects on alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c). The direct small glucose-induced drop in alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c) contributes likely only partly to the strong glucose-induced inhibition of glucagon secretion in islets.},

	Abstract = {Associative synaptic plasticity is synapse specific and requires coincident activity in pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons to activate NMDA receptors (NMDARs). The resultant Ca(2+) influx is the critical trigger for the induction of synaptic plasticity. Given its centrality for the induction of synaptic plasticity, a model for NMDAR activation incorporating the timing of pre-synaptic glutamate release and post-synaptic depolarization by back-propagating action potentials could potentially predict the pre- and post-synaptic spike patterns required to induce synaptic plasticity. We have developed such a model by incorporating currently available data on the timecourse and amplitude of the post-synaptic membrane potential within individual spines. We couple this with data on the kinetics of synaptic NMDARs and then use the model to predict the continuous spine [Ca(2+)] in response to regular or irregular pre- and post-synaptic spike patterns. We then incorporate experimental data from synaptic plasticity induction protocols by regular activity patterns to couple the predicted local peak [Ca(2+)] to changes in synaptic strength. We find that our model accurately describes [Ca(2+)] in dendritic spines resulting from NMDAR activation during pre-synaptic and post-synaptic activity when compared to previous experimental observations. The model also replicates the experimentally determined plasticity outcome of regular and irregular spike patterns when applied to a single synapse. This model could therefore be used to predict the induction of synaptic plasticity under a variety of experimental conditions and spike patterns.},

	Abstract = {We used the patch clamp technique in situ to test the hypothesis that slow oscillations in metabolism mediate slow electrical oscillations in mouse pancreatic islets by causing oscillations in KATP channel activity. Total conductance was measured over the course of slow bursting oscillations in surface β-cells of islets exposed to 11.1 mM glucose by either switching from current clamp to voltage clamp at different phases of the bursting cycle or by clamping the cells to -60 mV and running two-second voltage ramps from -120 to -50 mV every 20 s. The membrane conductance, calculated from the slopes of the ramp current-voltage curves, oscillated and was larger during the silent phase than during the active phase of the burst. The ramp conductance was sensitive to diazoxide, and the oscillatory component was reduced by sulfonylureas or by lowering extracellular glucose to 2.8 mM, suggesting that the oscillatory total conductance is due to oscillatory KATP channel conductance. We demonstrate that these results are consistent with the Dual Oscillator model, in which glycolytic oscillations drive slow electrical bursting, but not with other models in which metabolic oscillations are secondary to calcium oscillations. The simulations also confirm that oscillations in membrane conductance can be well estimated from measurements of slope conductance and distinguished from gap junction conductance. Furthermore, the oscillatory conductance was blocked by tolbutamide in isolated β-cells. The data, combined with insights from mathematical models, support a mechanism of slow (∼5 min) bursting driven by oscillations in metabolism, rather than by oscillations in the intracellular free calcium concentration.},

	Abstract = {The dependence of phospholipase C activity on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was studied in intact liver cells treated with the Ca2+-mobilizing hormone vasopressin, or not so treated. Phospholipase C (PLC) activity was estimated from the formation of [3H]inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and the degradation of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2). The [Ca2+]i of the cells was clamped from 29 to 1130 nM by quin2 loading. This wide concentration range was obtained by loading the hepatocytes with a high concentration of the Ca2+ indicator in low-Ca2+ medium or by using the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin in medium containing Ca2+. In resting cells, in which [Ca2+]i was 193 nM, treatment with 0.1 microM-vasopressin which stimulates liver PLC maximally, tripled InsP3 content and raised [Ca2+]i to 2 microM within 15 s. Lowering [Ca2+]i partially decreased cell InsP3 content as well as the ability of vasopressin to stimulate InsP3 formation maximally. At 29 nM, the lowest Ca2+ concentration obtained in isolated liver cells, basal InsP3 content was 64% of that measured in control cells. Addition of vasopressin no longer affected [Ca2+]i, but significantly increased InsP3 by 200%, although less than in the controls (300%). The maintenance of the greater part of the PLC response at constant [Ca2+]i indicated that, in the liver, InsP3 formation does not result from an increase in [Ca2+]i. The effects of lowering [Ca2+]i were reversible. When low cell [Ca2+]i was restored to a normal value, resting InsP3 content and the ability of vasopressin to stimulate InsP3 formation maximally by 300% were also restored. Raising [Ca2+]i from 193 to 1130 nM had little effect on the InsP3 content or the vasopressin-mediated increase in InsP3. In agreement with the stimulation of PLC activity by vasopressin, cell [3H]PtdInsP2 and total PtdInsP2 were degraded by application of this hormone for 15 s. In contrast, when [Ca2+]i was lowered to 29 nM, basal [3H]PtdInsP2 and total PtdInsP2 were increased by about 30%, [3H]PtdInsP2 was further increased by vasopressin, but total PtdInsP2 was not changed. These results show that, in intact hepatocytes, PLC is little affected by [Ca2+]i concentrations above 193 nM, but is partially dependent on Ca2+ below that value. They suggest that, in addition to activating PLC activity, vasopressin might stimulate PtdInsP2 synthesis, presumably via phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinase, and that this pathway might predominate in cells with low [Ca2+]i.},

	Abstract = {The etiology of airway hyperresponsiveness associated with asthma requires an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms mediating human airway smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction. The objective of this study was to determine how human airway SMC contraction (induced by histamine) and relaxation (induced by formoterol) are regulated by Ca(2+) oscillations and Ca(2+) sensitivity. The responses of human small airways and their associated SMCs were studied in human lung slices cut from agarose-inflated lungs. Airway contraction was measured with phase-contrast video microscopy. Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+) sensitivity of airway SMCs were measured with two-photon fluorescence microscopy and Ca(2+)-permeabilized lung slices. The agonist histamine induced contraction of human small airways by stimulating both an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in the SMCs in the form of oscillatory Ca(2+) waves and an increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity. The frequency of the Ca(2+) oscillations increased with histamine concentration, and correlated with increased contraction. Formoterol induced airway relaxation at low concentrations by initially decreasing SMC Ca(2+) sensitivity. At higher concentrations, formoterol additionally slowed or inhibited the Ca(2+) oscillations of the SMCs to relax the airways. The action of formoterol was only slowly reversed. Human lung slices provide a powerful experimental assay for the investigation of small airway physiology and pharmacology. Histamine induces contraction by simultaneously increasing SMC Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+) sensitivity. Formoterol induces long-lasting relaxation by initially reducing the Ca(2+) sensitivity and, subsequently, the frequency of the Ca(2+) oscillations of the airway SMCs.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium transient alternans (CTA) has a recognized role in arrhythmogenesis, but its origin is not yet fully understood. Recent models of CTA are based on a steep relationship between calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and its calcium load before release. This mechanism alone, however, does not explain recent observations of CTA without diastolic SR calcium content alternations. In addition, nanoscopic imaging of calcium dynamics has revealed that the elementary calcium release units of the SR can become refractory independently of their local calcium content. Here we show using a new physiologically detailed mathematical model of calcium cycling that luminal gating of the calcium release channels (RyRs) mediated by the luminal buffer calsequestrin (CSQN) can cause CTA independently of the steepness of the release-load relationship. In this complementary mechanism, CTA is caused by a beat-to-beat alternation in the number of refractory RyR channels and can occur with or without diastolic SR calcium content alternans depending on pacing conditions and uptake dynamics. The model has unique features, in that it treats a realistic number of spatially distributed and diffusively coupled dyads, each one with a realistic number of RyR channels, and that luminal CSQN buffering and gating is incorporated based on experimental data that characterizes the effect of the conformational state of CSQN on its buffering properties. In addition to reproducing observed features of CTA, this multiscale model is able to describe recent experiments in which CSQN expression levels were genetically altered as well as to reproduce nanoscopic measurements of spark restitution properties. The ability to link microscopic properties of the calcium release units to whole cell behavior makes this model a powerful tool to investigate the arrhythmogenic role of abnormal calcium handling in many pathological settings.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the amino-terminal region of the huntingtin (htt) protein, which underlies the loss of striatal and cortical neurons. Glutamate has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, and several studies suggest that the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) may represent a target for the treatment of HD.
AREAS COVERED: The main goal of this review is to discuss the current data in the literature regarding the role of mGluR5 in HD and evaluate the potential of mGluR5 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of HD. mGluR5 is highly expressed in the brain regions affected in HD and is involved in movement control. Moreover, mGluR5 interacts with htt and mutated htt profoundly affects mGluR5 signaling. However, mGluR5 stimulation can activate both neuroprotective and neurotoxic signaling pathways, depending on the context of activation.
EXPERT OPINION: Although the data published so far strongly indicate that mGluR5 plays a major role in HD-associated neurodegeneration, htt aggregation and motor symptoms, it is not clear whether mGluR5 stimulation can diminish or intensify neuronal cell loss and HD progression. Thus, future experiments will be necessary to further investigate the outcome of drugs acting on mGluR5 for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.},

	Abstract = {A model of the functional release unit (FRU) in rat cardiac muscle consisting of one dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and eight ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels, and the volume surrounding them, is formulated. It is assumed that no spatial [Ca2+] gradients exist in this volume, and that each FRU acts independently. The model is amenable to systematic parameter studies in which FRU dynamics are simulated at the channel level using Monte Carlo methods with Ca2+ concentrations simulated by numerical integration of a coupled system of differential equations. Using stochastic methods, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) shows both high gain and graded Ca2+ release that is robust when parameters are varied. For a single DHPR opening, the resulting RyR Ca2+ release flux is insensitive to the DHPR open duration, and is determined principally by local sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, consistent with experimental data on Ca2+ sparks. In addition, single RyR openings are effective in triggering Ca2+ release from adjacent RyRs only when open duration is long and SR Ca2+ load is high. This indicates relatively low coupling between RyRs, and suggests a mechanism that limits the regenerative spread of RyR openings. The results also suggest that adaptation plays an important modulatory role in shaping Ca2+ release duration and magnitude, but is not solely responsible for terminating Ca2+ release. Results obtained with the stochastic model suggest that high gain and gradedness can occur by the recruitment of independent FRUs without requiring spatial [Ca2+] gradients within a functional unit or cross-coupling between adjacent functional units.},

First, based on the voltage clamp experiments found in the literature, we focus on the principal ionic channels and their cognate currents involved in the generation of this electrical activity. Second, we provide the methodology of formulations of uterine ionic currents derived from a wide range of electrophysiological data. The model is validated step by step by comparing simulated voltage-clamp results with the experimental ones. The model reproduces successfully the generation of single spikes or trains of action potentials that fit with the experimental data. It allows analyzing ionic channels implications. Likewise, the calcium-dependent conductance influences significantly the cellular oscillatory behavior.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained new insight into the mechanisms for bursting in a class of theoretical models. We study Plant's model for Aplysia R-15 to illustrate our view of these so-called "parabolic" bursters, which are characterized by low spike frequency at the beginning and end of a burst. By identifying and analyzing the fast and slow processes we show how they interact mutually to generate spike activity and the slow wave which underlies the burst pattern. Our treatment is essentially the first step of a singular perturbation approach presented from a geometrical viewpoint and carried out numerically with AUTO. We determine the solution sets (steady state and oscillatory) of the fast subsystem with the slow variables treated as parameters. These solutions form the slow manifold over which the slow dynamics then define a burst trajectory. During the silent phase of a burst, the solution trajectory lies approximately on the steady state branch of the slow manifold and during the active phase of spiking, the trajectory sweeps through the oscillation branch. The parabolic nature of bursting arises from the (degenerate) homoclinic transition between the oscillatory branch and the steady state branch. We show that, for some parameter values, the trajectory remains strictly on the steady state branch (to produce a resting steady state or a pure slow wave without spike activity) or strictly in the oscillatory branch (continuous spike activity without silent phases). Plant's model has two slow variables: a calcium conductance and the intracellular free calcium concentration, which activates a potassium conductance. We also show how bursting arises from an alternative mechanism in which calcium inactivates the calcium current and the potassium conductance is insensitive to calcium. These and other biophysical interpretations are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Electrical activity plays a pivotal role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. Recent findings have shown that the electrophysiological characteristics of human β-cells differ from their rodent counterparts. We show that the electrophysiological responses in human β-cells to a range of ion channels antagonists are heterogeneous. In some cells, inhibition of small-conductance potassium currents has no effect on action potential firing, while it increases the firing frequency dramatically in other cells. Sodium channel block can sometimes reduce action potential amplitude, sometimes abolish electrical activity, and in some cells even change spiking electrical activity to rapid bursting. We show that, in contrast to L-type Ca2+-channels, P/Q-type Ca2+-currents are not necessary for action potential generation, and, surprisingly, a P/Q-type Ca2+-channel antagonist even accelerates action potential firing. By including SK-channels and Ca2+ dynamics in a previous mathematical model of electrical activity in human β-cells, we investigate the heterogeneous and nonintuitive electrophysiological responses to ion channel antagonists, and use our findings to obtain insight in previously published insulin secretion measurements. Using our model we also study paracrine signals, and simulate slow oscillations by adding a glycolytic oscillatory component to the electrophysiological model. The heterogenous electrophysiological responses in human β-cells must be taken into account for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying insulin secretion in health and disease, and as shown here, the interdisciplinary combination of experiments and modeling increases our understanding of human β-cell physiology.},

A similar response was obtained by the addition of IP3 to permeabilized cells but not by perfusion of cells with Ca2+ at concentrations similar to those measured in intact cells. It is concluded that in vivo, domains of high [Ca2+]i are transiently generated close to IP3-gated channels and sensed by nearby mitochondria; this may provide an efficient mechanism for optimizing mitochondrial activity upon cell stimulation.},

The technique can be applied with equivalent results to different cell models, transiently or permanently transfected. In all the cell types we analyzed, mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]m) increases rapidly and transiently upon stimulation with agonists coupled to InsP3 generation. We confirm that the high speed of mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation with this type of stimuli depends on the generation of local gradients of Ca2+ in the cytosol, close to the channels sensitive to InsP3. In fact, only activation of these channels, but not the simple release from internal stores, as that elicited by blocking the intracellular Ca2+ ATPases, results in a fast mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. We also provide evidence in favor of a microheterogeneity among mitochondria of the same cells, about 30% of them apparently sensing the microdomains of high cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c). The changes in [Ca2+]m appear sufficiently large to induce a rapid activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which can be followed by monitoring the level of NAD(P)H fluorescence. A general scheme can thus be envisaged by which the triggering of a plasma membrane receptor coupled to InsP3 generation raises the Ca2+ concentration both in the cytoplasm (thereby triggering energy-consuming processes, such as cell proliferation, motility, secretion, etc.) and in the mitochondria, where it activates the metabolic activity according to the increased cell needs.},

	Abstract = {The notion that the agonist-dependent increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, on ubiquitous signalling mechanism, occur with a tightly regulated spatio-temporal pattern has become an established concept in modern cell biology. As a consequence, the concept is emerging that the recruitment of specific intracellular targets and effector system mechanisms depends on exposure to local [Ca2+] that differs substantially from the mean [Ca2+]. A striking example is provided by mitochondria, intracellular organelles that have been overlooked for a long time in the field of calcium signalling due to the low affinity of their Ca(2+)-uptake pathways. We will summarize here some of the evidence indicating that these organelles actively participate in Ca2+ homeostasis in physiological conditions (with consequences not only for the control of their function, but also for the modulation of the complexity of calcium signals) because they have the capability to respond to microdomains of high [Ca2+] transiently generated in their proximity by the opening of Ca2+ channels.},

	Abstract = {The activity of hypothalamic GnRH neurons results in the intermittent release of GnRH required for reproductive function. This intermittent neurosecretory activity has been proposed to reflect integration of intrinsic properties of and synaptic input to GnRH neurons. Determining the relative impact of synaptic inputs at different locations on the GnRH neuron is difficult, if not impossible, using only experimental approaches. Thus, we used electrophysiological recordings and neuronal reconstructions to generate computer models of GnRH neurons to examine the effects of synaptic inputs at varying distances from the soma along dendrites. The parameters of the models were adjusted to duplicate measured passive and active electrophysiology of cells from mouse brain slices. Our morphological findings reinforce the emerging picture of a complex dendritic structure of GnRH neurons. Furthermore, analysis of reduced morphology models indicated that this population of cells is unlikely to exhibit low-frequency tonic spiking in the absence of synaptic input. Finally, applying realistic patterns of synaptic input to modeled GnRH neurons indicates that synapses located more than about 30% of the average dendrite length from the soma cannot drive firing at frequencies consistent with neuropeptide release. Thus, processing of synaptic input to dendrites of GnRH neurons is probably more complex than simple summation.},

	Abstract = {The impact of the A-type GABA (GABA-A) receptor in gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons is controversial. In adult GnRH neurons, the GABA-A receptor conductance has been reported to either hyperpolarize or depolarize GnRH neurons. Regardless of whether GABA is inhibitory or excitatory in GnRH neurons, GABAergic input would be integrated with post-synaptic potentials generated by other synaptic inputs. We used dynamic current clamping and compartmental computer modeling to examine the integration of AMPA-type glutamatergic input and GABA-mediated input in both the hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) and depolarizing (excitatory) modes in GnRH neurons from transgenic mice (Mus Musculus) generated on a C57BL6 background. In both living and model neurons, action potentials were most likely a few ms after a maximum in AMPA conductance coincided with a minimum in inhibitory GABA. Excitatory GABA interacted differently with AMPA, with spikes most likely, in both dynamic clamping of living neurons and in model neurons, when a maximum in AMPA coincided with the decay from peak of a maximum in GABA. Distributing synapses along the dendrite maximized the temporal relationship between AMPA and GABA conductances and therefore, the potential for spiking. Thus, these two dominant neurotransmitters could interact in multiple frames to generate action potentials in GnRH neurons.},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH) neurons form part of a central neural oscillator that controls sexual reproduction through intermittent release of the GnRH peptide. Activity of GnRH neurons, and by extension release of GnRH, has been proposed to reflect intrinsic properties and synaptic input of GnRH neurons. To study GnRH neurons, we used traditional electrophysiology and computational methods. These emerging methodologies enhance the elucidation of processing in GnRH neurons. We used dynamic current-clamping to understand how living GnRH somata process input from glutamate and GABA, two key neurotransmitters in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. In order to study the impact of synaptic integration in dendrites and neuronal morphology, we have developed full-morphology models of GnRH neurons. Using dynamic clamping, we have demonstrated that small-amplitude glutamatergic currents can drive repetitive firing in GnRH neurons. Furthermore, application of simulated GABAergic synapses with a depolarized reversal potential have revealed two functional subpopulations of GnRH neurons: one population in which GABA chronically depolarizes membrane potential (without inducing action potentials) and a second population in which GABAergic excitation results in slow spiking. Finally, when AMPA-type and GABA-type simulated inputs are applied together, action potentials occur when the AMPA-type conductance occurs during the descending phase of GABAergic excitation and at the nadir of GABAergic inhibition. Compartmental computer models have shown that excitatory synapses at >300 microns from somtata are unable to drive spiking with purely passive dendrites. In models with active dendrites, distal synapses are more efficient at driving spiking than somatic inputs. We then used our models to extend the results from dynamic current clamping at GnRH somata to distribute synaptic inputs along the dendrite. We show that propagation delays for dendritic synapses alter synaptic integration in GnRH neurons by widening the temporal window of interaction for the generation of action potentials. Finally, we have shown that changes in dendrite morphology can modulate the output of GnRH neurons by altering the efficacy of action potential generation in response to after-depolarization potentials (ADPs). Taken together, the methodologies of dynamic current clamping and multi-compartmental modeling can make major contributions to the study of synaptic integration and structure-function relationships in hypothalamic GnRH neurons. Use of these methodological approaches will continue to provide keen insights leading to conceptual advances in our understanding of reproductive hormone secretion in normal and pathological physiology and open the door to understanding whether the mechanisms of pulsatile GnRH release are conserved across species.},

	Abstract = {It is dogma that action potentials are initiated at the soma/axon hillock of neurons. However, dendrites often exhibit conductances necessary for spike generation and represent functionally independent processing compartments within neurons. GnRH neurons provide an interesting neuronal phenotype with simple, relatively unbranched, unipolar or bipolar dendrites of extensive lengths (>1000 microm) covered in spines. These neurons control fertility and must integrate a variety of internal homeostatic and external environmental cues. We used imaging, electrophysiological, and modeling studies to understand how they integrate and process information along dendrites. Simultaneous recordings from distal dendrites and somata of individual GnRH neurons indicate distal dendrites are the primary site of spike initiation in these cells. Compartmental modeling indicates that sites of spike initiation depend upon location of excitatory input and dendrite geometry. Together, these studies demonstrate a novel pattern of spike generation in mammalian neurons and indicate that afferent inputs within distal dendritic microdomains directly initiate action potentials.},

	Abstract = {The impact of structure in modulating synaptic signals originating in dendrites is widely recognized. In this study, we focused on the impact of dendrite morphology on a local spike generating mechanism which has been implicated in hormone secretion, the after depolarization potential (ADP). Using multi-compartmental models of hypothalamic GnRH neurons, we systematically truncated dendrite length and determined the consequence on ADP amplitude and repetitive firing. Decreasing the length of the dendrite significantly increased the amplitude of the ADP and increased repetitive firing. These effects were observed in dendrites both with and without active conductances suggesting they largely reflect passive characteristics of the dendrite. In order to test the findings of the model, we performed whole-cell recordings in GnRH neurons and elicited ADPs using current injection. During recordings, neurons were filled with biocytin so that we could determine dendritic and total projection (dendrite plus axon) length. Neurons exhibited ADPs and increasing ADP amplitude was associated with decreasing dendrite length, in keeping with the predictions of the models. Thus, despite the relatively simple morphology of the GnRH neuron's dendrite, it can still exert a substantial impact on the final neuronal output.},

	Abstract = {Vasopressin secreting neurons of the rat hypothalamus discharge lengthy, repeating bursts of action potentials in response to physiological stress. Although many electrical currents and calcium-dependent processes have been isolated and analyzed in these cells, their interactions are less well fathomed. In particular, the mechanism of how each burst is triggered, sustained, and terminated is poorly understood. We present a mathematical model for the bursting mechanism, and we support our model with new simultaneous electrical recording and calcium imaging data. We show that bursts can be initiated by spike-dependent calcium influx, and we propose that the resulting elevation of bulk calcium inhibits a persistent potassium current. This inhibition depolarizes the cell above threshold and so triggers regenerative spiking and further calcium influx. We present imaging data to show that bulk calcium reaches a plateau within the first few seconds of the burst, and our model indicates that this plateau occurs when calcium influx is balanced by efflux and uptake into stores. We conjecture that the burst is terminated by a slow, progressive desensitization to calcium of the potassium leak current. Finally, we propose that the opioid dynorphin, which is known to be secreted from the somatodendritic region and has been shown previously to regulate burst length and phasic activity in these cells, is the autocrine messenger for this desensitization.},

	Abstract = {1. Cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) by indo 1 microspectrofluorimetry in freshly isolated cells and isometric contraction of isolated rings were measured in response to muscarinic cholinoceptor stimulation in rat tracheal smooth muscle. 2. In isolated myocytes, acetylcholine (ACh, 0.03-1 microM) caused a rapid and graded increase in [Ca2+]i up to a net amplitude of 492 +/- 26 nM (n = 19) which gradually declined. The EC50 for ACh was 0.13 microM. This first [Ca2+]i peak was followed, when the ACh concentration increased, in approximately 50-60% of the cells, by successive peaks of decreased amplitude ([Ca2+]i oscillations) superimposed on the plateau phase. Whereas the percentage of cells exhibiting [Ca2+]i oscillations remained consistent, the frequency of these oscillations increased to up to 10 min-1 with an ACh concentration of 100 microM. 3. Removal of extracellular calcium (in the presence of EGTA, 0.4 mM) or addition of the voltage-dependent Ca(2+)-channel blocker verapamil (10 microM) did not alter the first [Ca2+]i peak, the plateau or the oscillations induced by ACh or carbachol. In contrast, the specific inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase, thapsigargin (1 microM), completely abolished the [Ca2+]i response. Thapsigargin (1 microM) also blocked the caffeine (5 mM)-induced transient rise in [Ca2+]i. 4. Atropine (a non-selective muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist) and 4-diphenyl acetoxy N-methyl piperidine (4-DAMP, a selective M3 antagonist) inhibited the [Ca2+]i response to muscarinic cholinoceptor activation with an IC50 of 13 and 20 nM, respectively. Pirenzepine (a selective M1 antagonist) also totally inhibited the [Ca2+]i response to ACh but with a higher IC50 of 2 microM. Methoctramine (a selective M2 antagonist) up to a concentration of 10 microM caused only a 40% inhibition. The effect of muscarinic antagonists on cumulative concentration-response curves (CCRC) for carbachol was assessed at the following concentrations: atropine and 4-DAMP at 3, 10 and 30 nM; pirenzepine 0.3, 1 and 3 microM, and methoctramine at 1, 3 and 10 microM. For these concentrations, all of the antagonists produced a rightward shift of the CCRC for carbachol and pA2 values were 9.2, 8.8, 6.7 and 6.3, respectively. 5. In conclusion, the present study indicates that muscarinic stimulation of rat isolated tracheal smooth muscle cells induces [Ca2+]i oscillations. The occurrence of these oscillations depends on the graded amplitude of the first [Ca2+]i rise and their frequency may play a role in the amplitude of the mechanical activity in response to muscarinic cholinoceptor activation. Both the [Ca2+]i and the contractile responses are primarily dependent on activation of the M3 receptor subtype.},

	Abstract = {1. Acetylcholine, the principal neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, is released at both ganglionic synapses and postganglionic neuroeffector junctions and acts by activation of nicotinic and muscarinic cholinoceptors. This review focuses on the effects of postjunctional muscarinic stimulation of airway smooth muscle. 2. On pharmacological criteria, four distinct subtypes of muscarinic cholinoceptor, denoted M1, M2, M3 and M4 receptors, have been identified by use of selective antagonists. Cloned muscarinic cholinoceptors are members of the family of GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors, which are characterized by seven transmembrane (TM) regions connected by intra- and extracellular loops. Between the fifth and the sixth TM regions, muscarinic receptors possess a large intracytoplasmic loop that is considered to be responsible for G-protein-coupling selectivity and exhibits high divergence between the different subtypes. 3. At the site of the smooth muscle itself, both binding and Northern blot studies have demonstrated, in a variety of species, that muscarinic receptor subtypes present are M2 and M3. M2 receptors are coupled to Gi proteins and adenylyl cyclase inhibition and thus to cAMP signaling. M3 receptors are coupled to Gq/11 protein and phosphoinositide hydrolysis and thus to calcium signaling. 4. Muscarinic-induced contraction of airway smooth muscle is mediated by M3 receptors. M2-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase contributes to the prevention of bronchodilation. Cross-talk between muscarinic and beta2 adrenoceptors is likely to be present in airway smooth muscle. The pathophysiological role of this cross-talk requires further investigation.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to use both a theoretical and experimental approach to determine the influence of the sarco-endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity and mitochondria Ca2+ uptake on Ca2+ homeostasis in airway myocytes. Experimental studies were performed on myocytes freshly isolated from rat trachea. [Ca2+]i was measured by microspectrofluorimetry using indo-1. Stimulation by caffeine for 30 s induced a concentration-graded response characterized by a transient peak followed by a progressive decay to a plateau phase. The decay phase was accelerated for 1-s stimulation, indicating ryanodine receptor closure. In Na2+-Ca2+-free medium containing 0.5 mM La3+, the [Ca2+]i response pattern was not modified, indicating no involvement of transplasmalemmal Ca2+ fluxes. The mathematical model describing the mechanism of Ca2+ handling upon RyR stimulation predicts that after Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the Ca2+ is first sequestrated by cytosolic proteins and mitochondria, and pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum after a time delay. Experimentally, we showed that the [Ca2+]i decay after Ca2+ increase was not altered by the SERCA inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid, but was slightly but significantly modified by the mitochondria uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone. The experimental and theoretical results indicate that, although Ca2+ pumping back by SERCA is active, it is not primarily involved in [Ca2+]i decrease that is due, in part, to mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.},

	Abstract = {Airway myocytes are the primary effectors of airway reactivity which modulates airway resistance and hence ventilation. Stimulation of airway myocytes results in an increase in the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and the subsequent activation of the contractile apparatus. Many contractile agonists, including acetylcholine, induce [Ca(2+)](i) increase via Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through InsP(3) receptors. Several models have been developed to explain the characteristics of InsP(3)-induced [Ca(2+)](i) responses, in particular Ca(2+) oscillations. The article reviews the modelling of the major structures implicated in intracellular Ca(2+) handling, i.e., InsP(3) receptors, SERCAs, mitochondria and Ca(2+)-binding cytosolic proteins. We developed theoretical models specifically dedicated to the airway myocyte which include the major mechanisms responsible for intracellular Ca(2+) handling identified in these cells. These biocomputations pointed out the importance of the relative proportion of InsP(3) receptor isoforms and the respective role of the different mechanisms responsible for cytosolic Ca(2+) clearance in the pattern of [Ca(2+)](i) variations. We have developed a theoretical model of membrane conductances that predicts the variations in membrane potential and extracellular Ca(2+) influx. Stimulation of this model by simulated increase in [Ca(2+)](i) predicts membrane depolarisation, but not great enough to trigger a significant opening of voltage-dependant Ca(2+) channels. This may explain why airway contraction induced by cholinergic stimulation does not greatly depend on extracellular calcium. The development of such models of airway myocytes is important for the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of airway reactivity and their possible modulation by pharmacological agents.},

	Abstract = {Calcium has been proposed as a postsynaptic signal underlying synaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We examine this hypothesis with computational modeling based on experimental results from hippocampal cultures, some of which are presented here, in which pairs and triplets of pre- and postsynaptic spikes induce potentiation and depression in a temporally asymmetric way. Specifically, we present a set of model biochemical detectors, based on plausible molecular pathways, which make direct use of the time course of the calcium signal to reproduce these experimental STDP results. Our model features a modular structure, in which long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) components compete to determine final plasticity outcomes; one aspect of this competition is a veto through which appropriate calcium time courses suppress LTD. Simulations of our model are also shown to be consistent with classical LTP and LTD induced by several presynaptic stimulation paradigms. Overall, our results provide computational evidence that, while the postsynaptic calcium time course contains sufficient information to distinguish various experimental long-term plasticity paradigms, small changes in the properties of back-propagation of action potentials or in synaptic dynamics can alter the calcium time course in ways that will significantly affect STDP induction by any detector based exclusively on postsynaptic calcium. This may account for the variability of STDP outcomes seen within hippocampal cultures, under repeated application of a single experimental protocol, as well as for that seen in multiple spike experiments across different systems.},

Recent models consist of deterministic reaction-diffusion equations coupled to stochastic transitions of calcium channels. The resulting dynamics is of multiple time and spatial scales, which complicates far-reaching computer simulations. In this article, we introduce a novel hybrid scheme that is especially tailored to accurately trace events with essential stochastic variations, while deterministic concentration variables are efficiently and accurately traced at the same time. We use finite elements to efficiently resolve the extreme spatial gradients of concentration variables close to a channel. We describe the algorithmic approach and we demonstrate its efficiency compared to conventional methods. Our single-channel model matches experimental data and results in intriguing dynamics if calcium is used as charge carrier. Random openings of the channel accumulate in bursts of calcium blips that may be central for the understanding of cellular calcium dynamics.},

	Abstract = {We study Ca(2+) release through single and clustered IP(3) receptor channels on the ER membrane under presence of buffer proteins. Our computational scheme couples reaction-diffusion equations and a Markovian channel model and allows our investigating the effects of buffer proteins on local calcium concentrations and channel gating. We find transient and stationary elevations of calcium concentrations around active channels and show how they determine release amplitude. Transient calcium domains occur after closing of isolated channels and constitute an important part of the channel's feedback. They cause repeated openings (bursts) and mediate increased release due to Ca(2+) buffering by immobile proteins. Stationary domains occur during prolonged activity of clustered channels, where the spatial proximity of IP(3)Rs produces a distinct [Ca(2+)] scale (0.5-10 microM), which is smaller than channel pore concentrations (>100 microM) but larger than transient levels. While immobile buffer affects transient levels only, mobile buffers in general reduce both transient and stationary domains, giving rise to Ca(2+) evacuation and biphasic modulation of release amplitude. Our findings explain recent experiments in oocytes and provide a general framework for the understanding of calcium signals.},

Recently it has been shown that high-frequency presynaptic stimulation enhances recovery from depression, which may be mediated by Ca2+. We addressed this issue by measuring quantal release rates at the calyx of Held synapse and found that transmission is mediated by a heterogeneous population of vesicles, with one subset releasing rapidly and recovering slowly and another one releasing reluctantly and recovering rapidly. Ca2+ promotes refilling of the rapidly releasing synaptic vesicle pool and calmodulin inhibitors block this effect. We propose that calmodulin-dependent refilling supports recovery from synaptic depression during high-frequency trains in concert with rapid recovery of the slowly releasing vesicles.},

	Abstract = {Experimental studies have demonstrated that Ca(2+)-regulated proteins are sensitive to the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations, and several mathematical models for specific proteins have provided insight into the mechanisms involved. Because of the large number of Ca(2+)-regulated proteins in signal transduction, metabolism and gene expression, it is desirable to establish in general terms which molecular properties shape the response to oscillatory Ca(2+) signals. Here we address this question by analyzing in detail a model of a prototypical Ca(2+)-decoding module, consisting of a target protein whose activity is controlled by a Ca(2+)-activated kinase and the counteracting phosphatase. We show that this module can decode the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations, at constant average Ca(2+) signal, provided that the Ca(2+) spikes are narrow and the oscillation frequency is sufficiently low--of the order of the phosphatase rate constant or below. Moreover, Ca(2+) oscillations activate the target more efficiently than a constant signal when Ca(2+) is bound cooperatively and with low affinity. Thus, the rate constants and the Ca(2+) affinities of the target-modifying enzymes can be tuned in such a way that the module responds optimally to Ca(2+) spikes of a certain amplitude and frequency. Frequency sensitivity is further enhanced when the limited duration of the external stimulus driving Ca(2+) signaling is accounted for. Thus, our study identifies molecular parameters that may be involved in establishing the specificity of cellular responses downstream of Ca(2+) oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Hypersecretion of glucagon contributes to the dysregulation of glucose homeostasis in diabetes. To clarify the underlying mechanism, glucose-regulated glucagon secretion was studied in mouse pancreatic islets and clonal hamster In-R1-G9 glucagon-releasing cells. Apart from the well-known inhibition of secretion with maximal effect around 7 mmol/l glucose, we discovered that mouse islets showed paradoxical stimulation of glucagon release at 25-30 mmol/l and In-R1-G9 cells at 12-20 mmol/l sugar. Whereas glucagon secretion in the absence of glucose was inhibited by hyperpolarization with diazoxide, this agent tended to further enhance secretion stimulated by high concentrations of the sugar. Because U-shaped dose-response relationships for glucose-regulated glucagon secretion were observed in normal islets and in clonal glucagon-releasing cells, both the inhibitory and stimulatory components probably reflect direct effects on the alpha-cells. Studies of isolated mouse alpha-cells indicated that glucose inhibited glucagon secretion by lowering the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration. However, stimulation of glucagon release by high glucose concentrations did not require elevation of Ca(2+), indicating involvement of novel mechanisms in glucose regulation of glucagon secretion. A U-shaped dose-response relationship for glucose-regulated glucagon secretion may explain why diabetic patients with pronounced hyperglycemia display paradoxical hyperglucagonemia.},

Mechanical stimulation of respiratory tract ciliated cells in culture induced a wave of increasing Ca2+ that spread, cell by cell, from the stimulated cell to neighboring cells. The communication of these Ca2+ waves between cells was restricted or blocked by halothane, an anesthetic known to uncouple cells. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the mechanically stimulated cell showed no change or a decrease in [Ca2+]i, whereas [Ca2+]i increased in neighboring cells. Iontophoretic injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) evoked a communicated Ca2+ response that was similar to that produced by mechanical stimulation.

The ability of a wide diversity of cells to display intercellular Ca2+ waves suggests that these Ca2+ waves may represent a general mechanism by which cells communicate. Although Ca2+ may permeate gap junctions, the intercellular movement of Ca2+ is not essential for the propagation of Ca2+ waves. The messenger that moves from one cell to the next through gap junctions appears to be IP3 and a regenerative mechanism for IP3 may be required to effect multicellular communication. Extracellularly mediated Ca2+ signaling also exists and this could be employed to supplement or replace gap junctional communication.

To explore these mechanisms, access to the intrapulmonary vessels is required and this is provided by the observation of a unique lung slice preparation with microscopy. There are 2 major processes that determine SMC tone; the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and the sensitivity of the SMCs to Ca(2+). Agonist-induced increases in Ca(2+) occur in the form of propagating Ca(2+) oscillations that predominately utilize internal Ca(2+) stores and inositol trisphosphate receptors. The frequency of these Ca(2+) oscillations correlates with contraction. Agonists also increase Ca(2+) sensitivity of SMCs to enhance contraction. Changes in membrane potential mediated by KCl also stimulate contraction via slow Ca(2+) oscillations and increased sensitivity. However, these slow Ca(2+) oscillations rely on Ca(2+) influx to drive the cyclic release of over-filled Ca(2+) stores via the ryanodine receptor. The relaxation of SMC tone can be induced by the reduction of the frequency of the Ca(2+) oscillations and the Ca(2+) sensitivity by b(2)-adrenergic agonists or nitric oxide.},

	Abstract = {The ability of mitochondria to capture Ca2+ ions has important functional implications for cells, because mitochondria shape cellular Ca2+ signals by acting as a Ca2+ buffer and respond to Ca2+ elevations either by increasing the cell energy supply or by triggering the cell death program of apoptosis. A mitochondrial Ca2+ channel known as the uniporter drives the rapid and massive entry of Ca2+ ions into mitochondria. The uniporter operates at high, micromolar cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations that are only reached transiently in cells, near Ca2+ release channels. Mitochondria can also take up Ca2+ at low, nanomolar concentrations, but this high affinity mode of Ca2+ uptake is not well characterized. Recently, leucine-zipper-EF hand-containing transmembrane region (Letm1) was proposed to be an electrogenic 1:1 mitochondrial Ca2+/H+ antiporter that drives the uptake of Ca2+ into mitochondria at nanomolar cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. In this article, we will review the properties of the Ca2+ import systems of mitochondria and discuss how Ca2+ uptake via an electrogenic 1:1 Ca2+/H+ antiport challenges our current thinking of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous calcium (Ca) sparks are initiated by single ryanodine receptor (RyR) opening. Once one RyR channel opens, it elevates local [Ca] in the cleft space ([Ca](Cleft)), which opens other RyR channels in the same Ca release unit (CaRU) via Ca-induced Ca-release. Experiments by Zima et al. (J. Physiol. 588:4743-4757, 2010) demonstrate that spontaneous Ca sparks occur only when intrasarcoplasmic-reticulum (SR) [Ca] ([Ca](SR)) is above a threshold level, but that RyR-mediated SR Ca leak exists without Ca sparks well below this threshold [Ca](SR). We examine here how single RyR opening at lower [Ca](SR) can fail to recruit Ca sparks at a CaRU, while still contributing to SR Ca leak. We assess this using a physiologically detailed mathematical model of junctional SR Ca release in which RyR gating is regulated by [Ca](SR) and [Ca](Cleft). We find that several factors contribute to the failure of Ca sparks as [Ca](SR) declines: 1), lower [Ca](SR) reduces driving force and thus limits local [Ca](Cleft) achieved and the rate of rise during RyR opening; 2), low [Ca](SR) limits RyR open time (τ(O)), which further reduces local [Ca](Cleft) attained; 3), low τ(O) and fast [Ca](Cleft) dissipation after RyR closure shorten the opportunity for neighboring RyR activation; 4), at low [Ca](SR), the RyR exhibits reduced [Ca](Cleft) sensitivity. We conclude that all of these factors conspire to reduce the probability of Ca sparks as [Ca](SR) declines, despite continued RyR-mediated Ca leak. In addition, these same factors explain the much lower efficacy of L-type Ca channel opening to trigger local SR Ca release at low [Ca](SR) during excitation-contraction coupling. Conversely, all of these factors are fundamentally important for increasing the propensity for pro-arrhythmic Ca sparks and waves in cardiac myocytes at high [Ca](SR).},

	Abstract = {This review provides a comparative overview of recent developments in the modelling of cellular calcium oscillations. A large variety of mathematical models have been developed for this wide-spread phenomenon in intra- and intercellular signalling. From these, a general model is extracted that involves six types of concentration variables: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), cytoplasmic, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial calcium, the occupied binding sites of calcium buffers, and the fraction of active IP3 receptor calcium release channels. Using this framework, the models of calcium oscillations can be classified into 'minimal' models containing two variables and 'extended' models of three and more variables. Three types of minimal models are identified that are all based on calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), but differ with respect to the mechanisms limiting CICR. Extended models include IP3--calcium cross-coupling, calcium sequestration by mitochondria, the detailed gating kinetics of the IP3 receptor, and the dynamics of G-protein activation. In addition to generating regular oscillations, such models can describe bursting and chaotic calcium dynamics. The earlier hypothesis that information in calcium oscillations is encoded mainly by their frequency is nowadays modified in that some effect is attributed to amplitude encoding or temporal encoding. This point is discussed with reference to the analysis of the local and global bifurcations by which calcium oscillations can arise. Moreover, the question of how calcium binding proteins can sense and transform oscillatory signals is addressed. Recently, potential mechanisms leading to the coordination of oscillations in coupled cells have been investigated by mathematical modelling. For this, the general modelling framework is extended to include cytoplasmic and gap-junctional diffusion of IP3 and calcium, and specific models are compared. Various suggestions concerning the physiological significance of oscillatory behaviour in intra- and intercellular signalling are discussed. The article is concluded with a discussion of obstacles and prospects.},

	Abstract = {"Ca(2+) buffers," a class of cytosolic Ca(2+)-binding proteins, act as modulators of short-lived intracellular Ca(2+) signals; they affect both the temporal and spatial aspects of these transient increases in [Ca(2+)](i). Examples of Ca(2+) buffers include parvalbumins (α and β isoforms), calbindin-D9k, calbindin-D28k, and calretinin. Besides their proven Ca(2+) buffer function, some might additionally have Ca(2+) sensor functions. Ca(2+) buffers have to be viewed as one of the components implicated in the precise regulation of Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+) homeostasis. Each cell is equipped with proteins, including Ca(2+) channels, transporters, and pumps that, together with the Ca(2+) buffers, shape the intracellular Ca(2+) signals. All of these molecules are not only functionally coupled, but their expression is likely to be regulated in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner to maintain normal Ca(2+) signaling, even in the absence or malfunctioning of one of the components.},

In addition to "classical" agonists such as phenylephrine and ATP, model environmental toxicants like 4-nitrophenol and 3,4-dichloroaniline were used to elucidate possible interactions between toxic effects and Ca(2+) signaling. We report Ca(2+) oscillations in response to several stimuli in RTL-W1 cells and to a lesser extent in primary hepatocytes. Moreover, these Ca(2+) oscillations are amplitude-encoded in contrast to their mammalian counterpart.

	Abstract = {Vasomotion consists of cyclic arterial diameter variations induced by synchronous contractions and relaxations of smooth muscle cells. However, the arteries do not contract simultaneously on macroscopic distances, and a propagation of the contraction can be observed. In the present study, our aim was to investigate this propagation. We stimulated endothelium-denuded rat mesenteric arterial strips with phenylephrine (PE) to obtain vasomotion and observed that the contraction waves are linked to intercellular calcium waves. A velocity of approximately 100 microm/s was measured for the two kinds of waves. To investigate the calcium wave propagation mechanisms, we used a method allowing a PE stimulation of a small area of the strip. No calcium propagation could be induced by this local stimulation when the strip was in its resting state. However, if a low PE concentration was added on the whole strip, local PE stimulations induced calcium waves, spreading over finite distances. The calcium wave velocity induced by local stimulation was identical to the velocity observed during vasomotion. This suggests that the propagation mechanisms are similar in the two cases. Using inhibitors of gap junctions and of voltage-operated calcium channels, we showed that the locally induced calcium propagation likely depends on the propagation of the smooth muscle cell depolarization. Finally, we proposed a model of the propagation mechanisms underlying these intercellular calcium waves.},

	Abstract = {Our aim was to measure the influence of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium content ([Ca](SRT)) and free SR [Ca] ([Ca](SR)) on the fraction of SR calcium released during voltage clamp steps in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. [Ca](SRT), as measured by caffeine application, was progressively increased by conditioning pulses. Sodium was absent in both the intracellular and in the extracellular solutions to block sodium/calcium exchange. Total cytosolic calcium flux during the transient was inferred from I(Ca), [Ca](SRT), [Ca](i), and cellular buffering characteristics. Fluxes via the calcium current (I(Ca)), the SR calcium pump, and passive leak from the SR were evaluated to determine SR calcium release flux (J(rel)). Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling was characterized with respect to both gain (integral J(rel)/integral I(Ca)) and fractional SR calcium release. Both parameters were virtually zero for a small, but measurable [Ca](SRT). Gain and fractional SR calcium release increased steeply and nonlinearly with both [Ca](SRT) and [Ca](SR). We conclude that potentiation of EC coupling can be correlated with both [Ca](SRT) and [Ca](SR). While fractional SR calcium release was not linearly dependent upon [Ca](SR), intra-SR calcium may play a crucial role in regulating the SR calcium release process.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ handling and ionic currents in the rabbit ventricular myocyte. The objective was to develop a model that: 1), accurately reflects Ca-dependent Ca release; 2), uses realistic parameters, particularly those that concern Ca transport from the cytosol; 3), comes to steady state; 4), simulates basic excitation-contraction coupling phenomena; and 5), runs on a normal desktop computer. The model includes the following novel features: 1), the addition of a subsarcolemmal compartment to the other two commonly formulated cytosolic compartments (junctional and bulk) because ion channels in the membrane sense ion concentrations that differ from bulk; 2), the use of realistic cytosolic Ca buffering parameters; 3), a reversible sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca pump; 4), a scheme for Na-Ca exchange transport that is [Na]i dependent and allosterically regulated by [Ca]i; and 5), a practical model of SR Ca release including both inactivation/adaptation and SR Ca load dependence. The data describe normal electrical activity and Ca handling characteristics of the cardiac myocyte and the SR Ca load dependence of these processes. The model includes a realistic balance of Ca removal mechanisms (e.g., SR Ca pump versus Na-Ca exchange), and the phenomena of rest decay and frequency-dependent inotropy. A particular emphasis is placed upon reproducing the nonlinear dependence of gain and fractional SR Ca release upon SR Ca load. We conclude that this model is more robust than many previously existing models and reproduces many experimental results using parameters based largely on experimental measurements in myocytes.},

Rojas, Cell Calcium. 4:451-461, proposed that the K-Ca channels, which are rarely open, are shared by several cells. This suggests that the chaotic behavior of isolated cells is stochastic. We have revised the Chay-Keizer model to incorporate voltage clamp data of Rorsman and Trube and extended it to include stochastic K-Ca channels. This model can describe the behavior of single cells, as well as that of clusters of cells tightly coupled by gap junctions. As the size of the clusters is increased, the electrical activity shows a transition from chaotic spiking to regular bursting. Although the model of coupling is over-simplified, the simulations lend support to the hypothesis that bursting is the result of channel sharing.},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic beta-cells coupled by gap junctions in sufficiently large clusters exhibit regular electrical bursting activity, which is described by the Chay-Keizer model and its variants. According to most reports, however, isolated cells exhibit disorganized spiking. We have previously (Sherman, A. J. Rinzel, and J. Keizer, 1988. Biophys. J. 54:411-425) modeled these behaviors by hypothesizing that stochastic channel fluctuations disrupt the bursts. We showed that when cells are coupled by infinite conductance gap junctions, so that the cluster is isopotential and may be viewed as a single "supercell," the fluctuations are shared over a larger membrane area and hence dampened. Bursting emerges when there are more than approximately 50 cells in the cluster. In the model the temporal organization of spikes into bursts increases the amplitude of intracellular calcium oscillations, which may be relevant for insulin secretion. We now extend the previous work by considering the case of a true "multicell" model with finite gap junctional conductance. Whereas the previous study assumed that the cells were synchronized, we can now study the process of synchronization itself. We show that, for sufficiently large clusters, the cells both synchronize and begin to burst with moderate, physiologically reasonable gap junctional conductance. An unexpected finding is that the burst period is longer, and calcium amplitude greater, than when coupling is infinitely strong, with an optimum in the range of 150-250 pS. Our model is in good agreement with recent experimental data of Perez-Armendariz, M., D. C. Spray, and M. V. L. Bennett. (1991. Biophys. J. 59:76-92) showing extensive gap junctions in beta-cell pairs with mean interfacial conductance of 213 +/- 113 pS. The optimality property of our model is noteworthy because simple slow-wave models without spikes do not show the same behavior.},

	Abstract = {Pituitary corticotroph cells generate repetitive action potentials and associated Ca2+ transients in response to the agonist corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). There is indirect evidence suggesting that the agonist, by way of complex intracellular mechanisms, modulates the voltage sensitivity of the L-type Ca2+ channels embedded in the plasma membrane. We have previously constructed a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of this process, which indicated that an increase in the L-type Ca2+ current is sufficient to generate repetitive action potentials (LeBeau et al. (1997). Biophys. J.73, 1263-1275). CRH is also believed to inhibit an inwardly rectifying K+ current. In this paper, we have found that a CRH-induced inhibition of the inwardly rectifying K+ current increases the model action potential firing frequency, [Ca2+]i transients and membrane excitability. This dual modulatory action of CRH on inward rectifier and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels better describes the observed CRH-induced effects. This structural alteration to the model along with parameter changes bring the model firing frequency in line with experimental data. We also show that the model exhibits experimentally observed bursting behaviour, where the depolarization spike is followed by small oscillations in the membrane potential.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ liberation through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) channels generates complex patterns of spatiotemporal cellular Ca2+ signals owing to the biphasic modulation of channel gating by Ca2+ itself. These processes have been extensively studied in Xenopus oocytes, where imaging studies have revealed local Ca2+ signals ("puffs") arising from clusters of IP3R, and patch-clamp studies on isolated oocyte nuclei have yielded extensive data on IP3R gating kinetics. To bridge these two levels of experimental data, we developed an IP3R model and applied stochastic simulation and transition matrix theory to predict the behavior of individual and clustered IP3R channels. The channel model consists of four identical, independent subunits, each of which has an IP3-binding site together with one activating and one inactivating Ca2+-binding site. The channel opens when at least three subunits undergo a conformational change to an "active" state after binding IP3 and Ca2+. The model successfully reproduces patch-clamp data; including the dependence of open probability, mean open duration, and mean closed duration on [IP3] and [Ca2+]. Notably, the biexponential distribution of open-time duration and the dependence of mean open time on [Ca2+] are explained by populations of openings involving either three or four active subunits. As a first step toward applying the single IP3R model to describe cellular responses, we then simulated measurements of puff latency after step increases of [IP3]. Assuming that stochastic opening of a single IP3R at basal cytosolic [Ca2+] and any given [IP3] has a high probability of rapidly triggering neighboring channels by calcium-induced calcium release to evoke a puff, optimal correspondence with experimental data of puff latencies after photorelease of IP3 was obtained when the cluster contained a total of 40-70 IP3Rs.},

	Abstract = {The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor/channel (IP(3)R) is a major regulator of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling, and liberates Ca(2+) ions from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to binding at cytosolic sites for both IP(3) and Ca(2+). Although the steady-state gating properties of the IP(3)R have been extensively studied and modeled under conditions of fixed [IP(3)] and [Ca(2+)], little is known about how Ca(2+) flux through a channel may modulate the gating of that same channel by feedback onto activating and inhibitory Ca(2+) binding sites. We thus simulated the dynamics of Ca(2+) self-feedback on monomeric and tetrameric IP(3)R models. A major conclusion is that self-activation depends crucially on stationary cytosolic Ca(2+) buffers that slow the collapse of the local [Ca(2+)] microdomain after closure. This promotes burst-like reopenings by the rebinding of Ca(2+) to the activating site; whereas inhibitory actions are substantially independent of stationary buffers but are strongly dependent on the location of the inhibitory Ca(2+) binding site on the IP(3)R in relation to the channel pore.},

	Abstract = {During oscillatory Ca(2+) signals, the agonist-induced enhanced entry of extracellular Ca(2+) plays a critical role in modulating the frequency of the oscillations. Although it was originally assumed that the entry of Ca(2+) under these conditions occurred via the well-known, and apparently ubiquitous, store-operated mechanism, subsequent studies suggested that this was unlikely. It is now known that, in many cell types, a novel non-capacitative Ca(2+)-selective pathway whose activation is dependent on arachidonic acid is responsible, and the channels involved [ARC channels (arachidonate-regulated Ca(2+) channels)] have been characterized. These ARC channels co-exist with the store-operated CRAC channels (Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) channel) in cells, but each plays a unique and non-overlapping role in Ca(2+) signalling. In particular, it is the ARC channels that are specifically activated at the low agonist concentrations that give rise to oscillatory Ca(2+) signals and provide the predominant mode of Ca(2+) entry under these conditions. The indications are that Ca(2+) entry through the ARC channels increases the likelihood that low concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) will trigger repetitive Ca(2+) release. At higher agonist concentrations, store-depletion is more complete and sustained resulting in the activation of CRAC channels. At the same time the ARC channels are turned off, resulting in what we have described as a reciprocal regulation of these two distinct Ca(2+) entry pathways.},

	Abstract = {The ARC channel is a small conductance, highly Ca²⁺-selective ion channel whose activation is specifically dependent on low concentrations of arachidonic acid acting at an intracellular site. They are widely distributed in diverse cell types where they provide an alternative, store-independent pathway for agonist-activated Ca²⁺ entry. Although biophysically similar to the store-operated CRAC channels, these two conductances function under distinct conditions of agonist stimulation, with the ARC channels providing the predominant route of Ca²⁺ entry during the oscillatory signals generated at low agonist concentrations. Despite these differences in function, like the CRAC channel, activation of the ARC channels is dependent on STIM1, but it is the pool of STIM1 that constitutively resides in the plasma membrane that is responsible. Similarly, both channels are formed by Orai proteins but, whilst the CRAC channel pore is a tetrameric assembly of Orai1 subunits, the ARC channel pore is formed by a heteropentameric assembly of three Orai1 subunits and two Orai3 subunits. There is increasing evidence that the activity of these channels plays a critical role in a variety of different cellular activities.},

Although methods for collecting data from single ion channels are available, translating a time series of open and closed channels to a CTMM remains a challenge. Bayesian statistics combined with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling provide means for estimating the rate constants of a CTMM directly from single channel data. In this article, different approaches for the MCMC sampling of Markov models are combined. This method, new to our knowledge, detects overparameterizations and gives more accurate results than existing MCMC methods. It shows similar performance as QuB-MIL, which indicates that it also compares well with maximum likelihood estimators. Data collected from an inositol trisphosphate receptor is used to demonstrate how the best model for a given data set can be found in practice.},

	Abstract = {Based upon an extensive single-channel data set, a Markov model for types I and II inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)R) is developed. The model aims to represent accurately the kinetics of both receptor types of IP(3)R depending on the concentrations of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)), adenosine trisphosphate (ATP), and intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)). In particular, the model takes into account that for some combinations of ligands the IP(3)R switches between extended periods of inactivity alternating with intervals of bursting activity (mode changes). In a first step, the inactive and active modes are modeled separately. It is found that, within modes, both receptor types are ligand-independent. In a second step, the submodels are connected by transition rates. Ligand-dependent regulation of the channel activity is achieved by modulating these transitions between active and inactive modes. As a result, a compact representation of the IP(3)R is obtained that accurately captures stochastic single-channel dynamics including mode changes in a model with six states and 10 rate constants, only two of which are ligand-dependent.},

This steady-state rapid buffering approximation gives an upper bound on local Ca2+ elevations such as Ca2+ puffs or sparks when conditions for the validity of the rapid buffering approximation are met and is an alternative to approximations that assume that mobile buffers are unsaturable. This result also provides an analytical estimate of the cytosolic Ca2+ domain concentration ([Ca2+]d) near a channel pore and shows the dependence of [Ca2+]d on moderate concentrations of endogenous mobile buffer, Ca2+ indicator dye, and bulk cytosolic Ca2+. Assuming a simple relationship between [Ca2+]d and the lumenal depletion domain of an intracellular Ca2+ channel, lumenal and cytosolic Ca2+ profiles are matched to give an implicit analytical expression for the effect of bulk lumenal Ca2+ on [Ca2+]d.},

Here we simulate the full and reduced equations, exploring the conditions necessary for the validity of the rapid buffering approximation for an isolated Ca2+ channel or a cluster of channels. Using a point source and performing numerical simulations of different durations, we quantify the error of the rapid buffering approximation as a function of buffer and source parameters as well as the time and spatial scale set by the resolution of confocal microscopic measurements. We carry out simulations of Ca2+ "sparks" and "puffs," both with and without the indicator dye Ca2+ Green-1, and find that the rapid buffering approximation is excellent. These calculations also show that the traditional calculation of [Ca2+] from a fluorescence signal may grossly underestimate the true value of [Ca2+] near a source. Finally, we use the full model to simulate the transient Ca2+ domain near the pore of an open Ca2+ channel in a cell dialyzed with millimolar concentrations of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid or EGTA.

However, when diffusion is included, the model no longer behaves like a generic excitable system; the fast and slow variables are not distinct and previous results on excitable systems do not necessarily apply. We consider a piecewise linear simplification of the model, and construct travelling pulse and periodic plane wave solutions to the simplified model. The analogous behaviour in the full model is studied numerically. Goldbeter's model for calcium-induced calcium release is an excitable system of a type not previously studied in detail.},

	Abstract = {In response to mechanical stimulation of a single cell, intercellular Ca2+ waves propagate through airway epithelial and glial cell cultures, providing a mechanism for intercellular communication. Experiments indicate that intercellular propagation of the Ca2+ wave is mediated by the movement of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) through gap junctions. To explore the validity of this hypothesis, we have constructed and solved a system of partial differential equations that models the Ca2+ changes induced by the movement of IP3 between cells. The model is in good qualitative agreement with experimental data, including the behavior of the wave in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the shape of the subsequent asynchronous Ca2+ oscillations, and the passage of a wave through a cell exhibiting Ca2+ oscillations. However, the concentration of IP3 that is required in each cell to propagate the wave may not be achieved by passive diffusion of IP3 through gap junctions from the stimulated cell. We therefore suggest that Ca(2+)-independent regenerative production of IP3 might be necessary for the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves.},

We present a detailed analysis of the intercellular wave in a two-dimensional sheet of cells. The model is based on the hypothesis that the wave is the result of diffusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from the stimulated cell. The two-dimensional model agrees well with experimental data and makes the following quantitative predictions: as the distance from the stimulated cells increases, 1) the intercellular delay increases exponentially, 2) the intracellular wave speed decreases exponentially, and 3) the arrival time increases exponentially. Furthermore, 4) a proportion of the cells at the periphery of the response will exhibit waves of decreased amplitude, 5) the intercellular membrane permeability to IP3 must be approximately 2 microns/s or greater, and 6) the ratio of the maximum concentration of IP3 in the stimulated cell to the Km of the IP3 receptor (with respect to IP3) must be approximately 300 or greater. These predictions constitute a rigorous test of the hypothesis that the intercellular Ca2+ waves are mediated by IP3 diffusion.},

Because of their inherent nonlinear nature and the consequent unreliability of intuitive approaches, mathematical modeling has an important role to play in the study of these phenomena. One important class of oscillations and waves is dependent on the presence of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3), which releases Ca2+ from internal stores via the IP3 receptor/Ca2+ channel. With the minimum possible mathematical formalism, we review mechanistic models for IP3-dependent Ca2+ oscillations and waves. These models are based on the regulation of the IP3 receptor by both IP3 and Ca2+, and incorporate experimental data on the steady-state and kinetic properties of the receptor. The extension of the models to describe intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ waves is considered.},

	Abstract = {In response to a local mechanical stimulus, mixed glial cells initially exhibit a propagating intercellular Ca2+ wave. Subsequently, cells within a zone, at a specific distance from the stimulated cell, display asynchronous intracellular Ca2+ oscillations. The experimental hypothesis that the initial Ca2+ wave could be mediated by the passive diffusion of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) from the stimulated cell has been verified by model simulations. Further simulations with the same model also show that Ca2+ oscillations can only occur within model cells when the IP3 concentration is within a specific range. Thus, this passive diffusion model predicts (a) that the IP3 concentration gradient established in the cells following mechanical stimulation will initiate Ca2+ oscillations in cells in a specific zone along this gradient and (b) that different Ca2+ oscillatory patterns will occur within a specified oscillatory zone. Both of these predictions have been confirmed by experimental data. The failure of experimentally observed Ca2+ oscillations to approach synchrony or entrain indicates a low intercellular calcium permeability of about 0.1 micron/s, and further suggests that Ca2+ does not appear to act as a significant messenger in the initiation of these intercellular Ca2+ waves or oscillations. In conclusion a passive diffusion of IP3, but not Ca2+, through gap junctions remains the preferred hypothesis for the mechanism underlying mechanically-stimulated intercellular calcium waves and Ca2+ oscillations.},

The apical and basal regions are separated by a region containing the mitochondria. In response to a whole-cell, homogeneous application of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)), the model predicts that 1), at lower concentrations of IP(3), the intracellular waves in pancreatic cells begin in the apical region and are actively propagated across the basal region by Ca(2+) release through ryanodine receptors; 2), at higher [IP(3)], the waves in pancreatic and parotid cells are not true waves but rather apparent waves, formed as the result of sequential activation of inositol trisphosphate receptors in the apical and basal regions; 3), the differences in wave propagation in pancreatic and parotid cells can be explained in part by differences in inositol trisphosphate receptor density; 4), in pancreatic cells, increased Ca(2+) uptake by the mitochondria is capable of restricting Ca(2+) responses to the apical region, but that this happens only for a relatively narrow range of [IP(3)]; and 5), at higher [IP(3)], the apical and basal regions of the cell act as coupled Ca(2+) oscillators, with the basal region partially entrained to the apical region.},

	Abstract = {It is known that Ca(2+) influx plays an important role in the modulation of inositol trisphosphate-generated Ca(2+) oscillations, but controversy over the mechanisms underlying these effects exists. In addition, the effects of blocking membrane transport or reducing Ca(2+) entry vary from one cell type to another; in some cell types oscillations persist in the absence of Ca(2+) entry (although their frequency is affected), whereas in other cell types oscillations depend on Ca(2+) entry. We present theoretical and experimental evidence that membrane transport can control oscillations by controlling the total amount of Ca(2+) in the cell (the Ca(2+) load). Our model predicts that the cell can be balanced at a point where small changes in the Ca(2+) load can move the cell into or out of oscillatory regions, resulting in the appearance or disappearance of oscillations. Our theoretical predictions are verified by experimental results from HEK293 cells. We predict that the role of Ca(2+) influx during an oscillation is to replenish the Ca(2+) load of the cell. Despite this prediction, even during the peak of an oscillation the cell or the endoplasmic reticulum may not be measurably depleted of Ca(2+).},

	Abstract = {A Ca(2+) spark arises when a cluster of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) channels (ryanodine receptors or RyRs) opens to release calcium in a locally regenerative manner. Normally triggered by Ca(2+) influx across the sarcolemmal or transverse tubule membrane neighboring the cluster, the Ca(2+) spark has been shown to be the elementary Ca(2+) signaling event of excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle. However, the question of how the Ca(2+) spark terminates remains a central, unresolved issue. Here we present a new model, "sticky cluster," of SR Ca(2+) release that simulates Ca(2+) spark behavior and enables robust Ca(2+) spark termination. Two newly documented features of RyR behavior have been incorporated in this otherwise simple model: "coupled gating" and an opening rate that depends on SR lumenal [Ca(2+)]. Using a Monte Carlo method, local Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release from clusters containing between 10 and 100 RyRs is modeled. After release is triggered, Ca(2+) flux from RyRs diffuses into the cytosol and binds to intracellular buffers and the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator fluo-3 to produce the model Ca(2+) spark. Ca(2+) sparks generated by the sticky cluster model resemble those observed experimentally, and Ca(2+) spark duration and amplitude are largely insensitive to the number of RyRs in a cluster. As expected from heart cell investigation, the spontaneous Ca(2+) spark rate in the model increases with elevated cytosolic or SR lumenal [Ca(2+)]. Furthermore, reduction of RyR coupling leads to prolonged model Ca(2+) sparks just as treatment with FK506 lengthens Ca(2+) sparks in heart cells. This new model of Ca(2+) spark behavior provides a "proof of principle" test of a new hypothesis for Ca(2+) spark termination and reproduces critical features of Ca(2+) sparks observed experimentally.},

	Abstract = {Computer simulation was used to investigate the calcium levels after sarcolemmal calcium influx through L-type calcium channels (DHPRs) into the narrow diadic space of cardiac muscle. The effect of various cytosolic and membranebound buffers, diad geometry, DHPR properties (open time and current), and surface charge were examined. The simulations showed that phospholipid binding sites on the sarcolemmal membrane are the major buffer affecting free calcium ([Ca2+]) levels in the diad. The inclusion of surface charge effects calculated from Gouy-Chapman theory resulted in a marked decrease in [Ca2+] levels at all times and a faster decay of [Ca2+] after termination of DHPR influx. For a DHPR current of 200 fA, [Ca2+] at the center of the diad reached peak levels of approximately 73 microM. In larger diads (> or = 400 nm diameter), [Ca2+] decayed more slowly than in smaller diads (100-200 nm diameter), although peak [Ca2+] levels reached during typical DHPR open times were similar. For a wide range of DHPR single-channel current magnitudes (Ica = 25-200 fA), [Ca2+] levels in the diad were approximately proportional to ICa. The decrease in calculated [Ca2+] levels due to the effects of surface charge can be interpreted as resulting from an effective "volume expansion" of the diad space. Furthermore, the layer of increased [Ca2+] close to the sarcolemmal membrane can act as a fast buffer.},

	Abstract = {Using a combination of experimental and numerical approaches, we have tested two different approaches to calculating the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release flux, which gives rise to cardiac muscle Ca2+ sparks. By using two-photon excited spot photolysis of DM-Nitrophen, known Ca2+ release flux time courses were generated to provide the first experimental validation of spark flux reconstruction algorithms. These artificial Ca2+ sparks show that it is possible to calculate the SR Ca2+ release waveform with reasonable accuracy, provided the flux equations reasonably reflect the properties of the experimental system. Within cardiac muscle cells, we show that Ca2+ flux reconstruction is complicated by the substantial dye binding to proteins, a factor that has not been adequately addressed in previous flux reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore, our numerical experiments suggest that the calculated time course of release flux inactivation based on conventional flux reconstruction algorithms is likely to be in error. We therefore developed novel algorithms based on an explicit dye binding scheme. When these algorithm were applied to evoked Ca2+ sparks in rat cardiac ventricular myocytes, the reconstructed Ca2+ release waveform peaked in ~5 ms and decayed with a halftime of approximately 5 ms. The peak flux magnitude was 7-12 pA, suggesting that sparks must arise from clusters of >15 ryanodine receptors.},

	Abstract = {Cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling describes the process that links sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels to Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors (RyRs). This process has proven difficult to study experimentally, and complete descriptions of how the cell couples surface membrane and intracellular signal transduction proteins to achieve both stable and sensitive intracellular calcium release are still lacking. Mathematical models provide a framework to test our understanding of how this is achieved. While no single model is yet capable of describing all features of cardiac E-C coupling, models of increasing complexity are revealing unexpected subtlety in the process. In particular, modelling has established a general failure of 'common-pool' models and has emphasized the requirement for 'local control' so that microscopic sub-cellular domains can separate local behaviour from the whole-cell average (common-pool) behaviour. The micro-architecture of the narrow diadic cleft in which the local control takes place is a key factor in determining local Ca2+ dynamics. There is still considerable uncertainty about the number of Ca2+ ions required to open RyRs within the cleft and various gating models have been proposed, many of which are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. However, not all models exhibit a realistic voltage dependence of E-C coupling gain. Furthermore, it is unclear which model features are essential to producing reasonable gain properties. Thus, despite the success of local-control models in explaining many features of cardiac E-C coupling, more work will be needed to provide a sound theoretical basis of cardiac E-C coupling.},

	Abstract = {Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) serve important neuromodulatory roles at glutamatergic synapses to shape excitatory neurotransmission. Recent evidence indicates that the desensitization of mGluRs is an important determinant in regulating the functions of these receptors. The present results demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), which are known to regulate the desensitization of many G protein-coupled receptors, regulate both the expression and function of mGluR5 in a heterologous expression system. This regulatory event is limited to members of the GRK2 family since GRK4 family members do not elicit the same effects on mGluR5. Kinase activity is shown to be required for GRK-mediated regulation of mGluR5. Furthermore, the ability of GRK2 to regulate mGluR5 is dependent, at least in part, on the presence of threonine 840 in the carboxyl terminus of mGluR5. These studies identify novel roles for GRKs in regulating mGluR5 that may serve to further shape the function of these receptors in neurotransmission.},

	Abstract = {Several receptors for neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors cause accelerated phosphodiesteratic breakdown of polyphosphoinositides when activated. One of the soluble products of this reaction, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) is thought to act as a second messenger signalling the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In support of this hypothesis, several studies have shown that Ins(1,4,5)P3 releases sequestered Ca2+ from permeable cells and microsomes. On the basis of certain structural requirements for Ca2+-releasing activity by inositol phosphates, it has been postulated that Ins(1,4,5)P3 acts by binding to a specific intracellular receptor, probably on a component of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report that 32P-Ins(1,4,5)P3 binds to a specific saturable site in permeabilized guinea pig hepatocytes and rabbit neutrophils, and that the properties of this binding site suggest that it is the physiological receptor for Ins(1,4,5)P3.},

	Abstract = {The Ca(2+) coupling between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is central to multiple cell survival and cell death mechanisms. Cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](c)) spikes and oscillations produced by ER Ca(2+) release are effectively delivered to the mitochondria. Propagation of [Ca(2+)](c) signals to the mitochondria requires the passage of Ca(2+) across three membranes, namely the ER membrane, the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Strategic positioning of the mitochondria by cytoskeletal transport and interorganellar tethers provides a means to promote the local transfer of Ca(2+) between the ER membrane and OMM. In this setting, even >100 microM [Ca(2+)] may be attained to activate the low affinity mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. However, a mitochondrial [Ca(2+)] rise has also been documented during submicromolar [Ca(2+)](c) elevations. Evidence has been emerging that Ca(2+) exerts allosteric control on the Ca(2+) transport sites at each membrane, providing mechanisms that may facilitate the Ca(2+) delivery to the mitochondria. Here we discuss the fundamental mechanisms of ER and mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport, particularly the control of their activity by Ca(2+) and evaluate both high- and low-[Ca(2+)]-activated mitochondrial calcium signals in the context of cell physiology.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes, a special type of glial cells, were considered to have supporting role in information processing in the brain. However, several recent studies have shown that they can be chemically stimulated by neurotransmitters and use a form of signaling, in which ATP acts as an extracellular messenger. Pathological conditions, such as spreading depression, have been linked to abnormal range of wave propagation in astrocytic cellular networks. Nevertheless, the underlying intra- and inter-cellular signaling mechanisms remain unclear. Motivated by the above, we constructed a model to understand the relationship between single-cell signal transduction mechanisms and wave propagation and blocking in astrocytic networks. The model incorporates ATP-mediated IP3 production, the subsequent Ca2+ release from the ER through IP3R channels and ATP release into the extracellular space. For the latter, two hypotheses were tested: Ca2+- or IP3-dependent ATP release. In the first case, single astrocytes can exhibit excitable behavior and frequency-encoded oscillations. Homogeneous, one-dimensional astrocytic networks can propagate waves with infinite range, while in two dimensions, spiral waves can be generated. However, in the IP3-dependent ATP release case, the specific coupling of the driver ATP-IP3 system with the driven Ca2+ subsystem leads to one- and two-dimensional wave patterns with finite range of propagation.},

	Abstract = {The consequences of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling by calcium-induced calcium release were studied theoretically, using a series of idealized models solved by analytic and numerical methods. "Common-pool" models, those in which the trigger calcium and released calcium pass through a common cytosolic pool, gave nearly all-or-none regenerative calcium releases (in disagreement with experiment), unless their loop gain was made sufficiently low that it provided little amplification of the calcium entering through the sarcolemma. In the linear (small trigger) limit, it was proven rigorously that no common-pool model can give graded high amplification unless it is operated on the verge of spontaneous oscillation. To circumvent this problem, we considered two types of "local-control" models. In the first type, the local calcium from a sarcolemmal L-type calcium channel directly stimulates a single, immediately opposed SR calcium release channel. This permits high amplification without regeneration, but requires high conductance of the SR channel. This problem is avoided in the second type of local control model, in which one L-type channel triggers a regenerative cluster of several SR channels. Statistical recruitment of clusters results in graded response with high amplification. In either type of local-control model, the voltage dependence of SR calcium release is not exactly the same as that of the macroscopic sarcolemmal calcium current, even though calcium is the only trigger for SR release. This results from the existence of correlations between the stochastic openings of individual sarcolemmal and SR channels. Propagation of regenerative calcium-release waves (under conditions of calcium overload) was analyzed using analytically soluble models in which SR calcium release was treated phenomenalogically. The range of wave velocities observed experimentally is easily explained; however, the observed degree of refractoriness to wave propagation requires either a strong dependence of SR calcium release on the rate of rise of cytosolic calcium or localization of SR release sites to one point in the sarcomere. We conclude that the macroscopic behavior of calcium-induced calcium release depends critically on the spatial relationships among sarcolemmal and SR calcium channels, as well as on their kinetics.},

	Abstract = {The function of calcium entry or release channels is often modulated by the cytosolic free calcium concentration. When such channels are studied in isolation, calcium buffer solutions are usually used to control the free calcium at the cytosolic face of the channel. Such solutions are generally formulated on the basis of equilibrium considerations. We calculate the gradient of [Ca2+] in the vicinity of a channel pore, in the presence of such buffers. We find that the effective degree of buffering near the pore is markedly affected by kinetic considerations. Commonly used EGTA solutions are completely ineffective in buffering [Ca2+] within macromolecular distances of the pore. In order to achieve useful buffering, the fastest buffers (e.g. BAPTA derivatives) must be used, in concentrations very much higher than those conventionally employed. Because of the diffusion limit on the maximum rate of binding of calcium to the buffer ligand, it is physically impossible to achieve good control of [Ca2+] at cytosolic levels at distances of less than a few nm from a pore conducting pico-ampere calcium current.},

	Abstract = {In pancreatic acinar cells, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3))-dependent cytosolic calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) increases resulting from agonist stimulation are initiated in an apical &quot;trigger zone,&quot; where the vast majority of InsP(3) receptors (InsP(3)R) are localized. At threshold stimulation, [Ca(2+)](i) signals are confined to this region, whereas at concentrations of agonists that optimally evoke secretion, a global Ca(2+) wave results. Simple diffusion of Ca(2+) from the trigger zone is unlikely to account for a global [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. Furthermore, mitochondrial import has been reported to limit Ca(2+) diffusion from the trigger zone. As such, there is no consensus as to how local [Ca(2+)](i) signals become global responses. This study therefore investigated the mechanism responsible for these events. Agonist-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations were converted to sustained [Ca(2+)](i) increases after inhibition of mitochondrial Ca(2+) import. These [Ca(2+)](i) increases were dependent on Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and were blocked by 100 microM ryanodine. Similarly, &quot;uncaging&quot; of physiological [Ca(2+)](i) levels in whole-cell patch-clamped cells resulted in rapid activation of a Ca(2+)-activated current, the recovery of which was prolonged by inhibition of mitochondrial import. This effect was also abolished by ryanodine receptor (RyR) blockade. Photolysis of d-myo InsP(3) P(4(5))-1-(2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl ester (caged InsP(3)) produced either apically localized or global [Ca(2+)](i) increases in a dose-dependent manner, as visualized by digital imaging. Mitochondrial inhibition permitted apically localized increases to propagate throughout the cell as a wave, but this propagation was inhibited by ryanodine and was not seen for minimal control responses resembling [Ca(2+)](i) puffs. Global [Ca(2+)](i) rises initiated by InsP(3) were also reduced by ryanodine, limiting the increase to a region slightly larger than the trigger zone. These data suggest that, while Ca(2+) release is initially triggered through InsP(3)R, release by RyRs is the dominant mechanism for propagating global waves. In addition, mitochondrial Ca(2+) import controls the spread of Ca(2+) throughout acinar cells by modulating RyR activation.},

	Abstract = {Calcium release via intracellular Ca2+ release channels is a central event underpinning the generation of numerous, often divergent physiological processes. In electrically non-excitable cells, this Ca2+ release is brought about primarily through activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and typically takes the form of calcium oscillations. It is widely believed that information is carried in the temporal and spatial characteristics of these signals. Furthermore, stimulation of individual cells with different agonists can generate Ca2+ oscillations with dramatically different spatial and temporal characteristics. Thus, mechanisms must exist for the acute regulation of Ca2+ release such that agonist-specific Ca2+ signals can be generated. One such mechanism by which Ca2+ signals can be modulated is through simultaneous activation of multiple second messenger pathways. For example, activation of both the InsP3 and cAMP pathways leads to the modulation of Ca2+ release through protein kinase A mediated phosphoregulation of the InsP3R. Indeed, each InsP3R subtype is a potential substrate for PKA, although the functional consequences of this phosphorylation are not clear. This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of phosphoregulation of InsP3R, as well as the functional consequences of this modulation in terms of eliciting specific cellular events.},

	Abstract = {Activation of receptors for a wide variety of hormones and neurotransmitters leads to an increase in the intracellular level of calcium. Much of this calcium is released from intracellular stores but the link between surface receptors and this internal calcium reservoir is unknown. Hydrolysis of the phosphoinositides, which is another characteristic feature of these receptors, has been implicated in calcium mobilization. The primary lipid substrates for the receptor mechanism seem to be two polyphosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns4,5P2), which are rapidly hydrolysed following receptor activation in various cells and tissues. The action of phospholipase C on these polyphosphoinositides results in the rapid formation of the water-soluble products inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins1,4P2) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins1,4,5P3). In the insect salivary gland, where changes in Ins1,4P2 and Ins1,4,5P2 have been studied at early time periods, increases in these inositol phosphates are sufficiently rapid to suggest that they might mobilize internal calcium. We report here that micromolar concentrations of Ins1,4,5P3 release Ca2+ from a nonmitochondrial intracellular Ca2+ store in pancreatic acinar cells. Our results strongly suggest that this is the same Ca2+ store that is released by acetylcholine.},

	Abstract = {1. The elementary release events underlying inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated calcium signalling were investigated in Xenopus oocytes by means of high-resolution confocal linescan imaging together with flash photolysis of caged InsP3. 2. Weak photolysis flashes evoked localized, transient calcium signals that arose at specific sites following random latencies of up to several seconds. The duration, spatial spread and amplitude of these elementary events varied widely. Event durations (at half-maximal amplitude) were distributed exponentially between about 100 and 600 ms. Fluorescence magnitudes (F/F0 of Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1) showed a skewed distribution with a peak at about 1.5 and a tail extending as high as 3.5. 3. Individual release sites exhibited both small events (blips) and large events (puffs). The spatiotemporal distribution of calcium signals during puffs was consistent with calcium diffusion from a point source (< a few hundred nanometres), rather than with propagation of a microscopic calcium wave. 4. Estimates of the calcium flux associated with individual events were made by integrating fluorescence profiles along the scan line in three dimensions to derive the 'signal mass' at each time point. The smallest resolved events corresponded to liberation of < 2 x 10-20 mol Ca2+, and large events to about 2 x 10-18 mol Ca2+. The rise of signal mass was more prolonged than that of the fluorescence intensity, suggesting that calcium liberation persists even while the fluorescence begins to decline. Rates of rise of signal mass corresponded to Ca2+ currents of 0.4-2.5 pA. 5. Measurements of signal mass from different events showed a continuous, exponential distribution, arising through variability in magnitude and duration of calcium flux. 6. We conclude that localized calcium transients in the oocyte represent a continuum of events involving widely varying amounts of calcium liberation, rather than falling into separate populations of 'fundamental' and 'elementary' events (blips and puffs) involving, respectively, single and multiple InsP3 receptor channels. This variability probably arises through stochastic variation in both the number of channels recruited and the duration of channel opening.},

The addition of IP(3) at concentrations ranging from 100 nm to 100 microm, in the presence of thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases, promoted a rapid decrease in the Ca(2+) content of GA vesicles. The amount of Ca(2+) released from the vesicles was a function of IP(3) concentration, reaching about 60% in both GA and ER fractions at 100 microm IP(3). Calcium release was inhibited by heparin, an antagonist of IP(3) receptors. Calcium exhibited a bell-shaped effect on IP(3)-dependent Ca(2+) released from GA vesicles: it activated Ca(2+) release at concentrations up to 1 microm, and inhibited it at higher concentrations. In contrast to that found in the endoplasmic reticulum fraction, none of the ryanodine receptor agonists tested (cyclic ADP-ribose, caffeine and ryanodine) significantly induced Ca(2+) release from GA fraction vesicles in the presence of thapsigargin. Our results indicate the presence of an IP(3)-sensitive Ca(2+) release mechanism in the Golgi apparatus membrane analogous to that of the ER. However, a Ca(2+) release mechanism sensitive to ryanodine receptor agonists like that of ER is not evident in the GA membrane.},

	Abstract = {When sperm activate eggs at fertilization the signal for activation involves increases in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. In mammals the Ca2+ changes at fertilization consist of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations that are driven by the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). It is not established how sperm trigger the increases in InsP3 and Ca2+ at fertilization. One theory suggests that sperm initiate signals to activate the egg by introducing a specific factor into the egg cytoplasm after membrane fusion. This theory has been mainly based upon the observation that injecting a cytosolic sperm protein factor into eggs can trigger the same pattern of Ca2+ oscillations induced by the sperm. We have recently shown that this soluble sperm factor protein is a novel form of phospholipase C (PLC), and it is referred to as PLCzeta(zeta). We describe the evidence that led to the identification of PLCzeta and discuss the issues relating to its potential role in fertilization.},

	Abstract = {It has been known for some time that mammalian eggs are activated by a series of intracellular calcium oscillations that occur shortly after sperm egg membrane fusion. Recent work has identified a novel sperm specific phospholipase C zeta as the likely agent that stimulates the calcium oscillations in eggs after sperm-egg membrane fusion. PLCzeta is stimulated by low intracellular calcium levels in a manner which suggests that there is a regenerative feedback of calcium release and PLCzeta induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate (InsP3) production in eggs. This implies calcium oscillations in fertilizing mammalian eggs are driven by underlying oscillations of InsP3. This model of oscillations is supported by the response of mouse eggs to sudden increases in InsP3. The cellular targets of calcium oscillations include calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase C and mitochondria. There is evidence that eggs might be best activated by multiple calcium increases rather than a single calcium rise. As yet we do not fully understand how the target of calcium in a mammalian egg might decode the patterns of calcium changes that can occur during egg activation.},

	Abstract = {Anxiety and stress disorders are the most commonly occurring of all mental illnesses, and current treatments are less than satisfactory. So, the discovery of novel approaches to treat anxiety disorders remains an important area of neuroscience research. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors function to regulate excitability via pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. Various mGlu receptor subtypes, including group I (mGlu(1) and mGlu(5)), group II (mGlu(2) and mGlu(3)), and group III (mGlu(4), mGlu(7) and mGlu(8)) receptors, specifically modulate excitability within crucial brain structures involved in anxiety states. In addition, agonists for group II (mGlu(2/3)) receptors and antagonists for group I (in particular mGlu(5)) receptors have shown activity in animal and/or human conditions of fear, anxiety or stress. These studies indicate that metabotropic glutamate receptors are interesting new targets to treat anxiety disorders in humans.},

	Abstract = {The electrical activity pattern of endocrine pituitary cells regulates their basal secretion level. Rat somatotrophs and lactotrophs exhibit spontaneous bursting and have high basal levels of hormone secretion, while gonadotrophs exhibit spontaneous spiking and have low basal hormone secretion. It has been proposed that the difference in electrical activity between bursting somatotrophs and spiking gonadotrophs is due to the presence of large conductance potassium (BK) channels on somatotrophs but not on gonadotrophs. This is one example where the role of an ion channel type may be clearly established. We demonstrate here that BK channels indeed promote bursting activity in pituitary cells. Blocking BK channels in bursting lacto-somatotroph GH4C1 cells changes their firing activity to spiking, while further adding an artificial BK conductance via dynamic clamp restores bursting. Importantly, this burst-promoting effect requires a relatively fast BK activation/deactivation, as predicted by computational models. We also show that adding a fast-activating BK conductance to spiking gonadotrophs converts the activity of these cells to bursting. Together, our results suggest that differences in BK channel expression may underlie the differences in electrical activity and basal hormone secretion levels among pituitary cell types and that the rapid rate of BK channel activation is key to its role in burst promotion.},

	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) 3-kinase catalyses the phosphorylation of InsP3 to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4). InsP3 3-kinase activity was stimulated by Ca2+ in the presence of calmodulin (CaM) and the protein was associated with two silver-stained bands which migrated with an apparent Mr of approx. 50,000 on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. Upon limited proteolysis with trypsin, the native InsP3 3-kinase was converted into polypeptides of Mr 44,000 and 36,000. Both tryptic fragments displayed InsP3 3-kinase activity that was Ca2+/CaM-sensitive. A cDNA clone, C5, that encodes the C-terminal part of the InsP3 3-kinase, was isolated by immunoscreening of a rat brain cDNA library. The 5' end of this clone was used in turn to probe the same library, yielding a clone (CP16) containing the entire coding sequence of InsP3 3-kinase. The encoding protein of 459 amino acids (calculated Mr 50,868) has several putative phosphorylation sites for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C and CaM-dependent protein kinase II. When clone C5 was expressed in Escherichia coli, the truncated fusion protein showed Ca2+/CaM-sensitive InsP3 3-kinase activity. Our data demonstrate that the N-terminal part of the protein is not essential for either enzymic or CaM-regulatory properties.},

	Abstract = {We study the models for calcium (Ca) dynamics developed in earlier studies, in each of which the key component is the kinetics of intracellular inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca channels. After rapidly equilibrating steps are eliminated, the channel kinetics in these models are represented by a single differential equation that is linear in the state of the channel. In the reduced kinetic model, the graph of the steady-state fraction of conducting channels as a function of log10(Ca) is a bell-shaped curve. Dynamically, a step increase in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate induces an incremental increase in the fraction of conducting channels, whereas a step increase in Ca can either potentiate or inhibit channel activation, depending on the Ca level before and after the increase. The relationships among these models are discussed, and experimental tests to distinguish between them are given. Under certain conditions the models for intracellular calcium dynamics are reduced to the singular perturbed form epsilon dx/d tau = f(x, y, p), dy/d tau = g(x, y, p). Phase-plane analysis is applied to a generic form of these simplified models to show how different types of Ca response, such as excitability, oscillations, and a sustained elevation of Ca, can arise. The generic model can also be used to study frequency encoding of hormonal stimuli, to determine the conditions for stable traveling Ca waves, and to understand the effect of channel properties on the wave speed.},

At crayfish neuromuscular junctions, basal transmission and facilitation were significantly reduced after presynaptic introduction of "fast" high-affinity calcium buffers, and the decay of facilitation was accelerated. The existence of residual calcium during facilitation was also demonstrated. Computational modeling of three-dimensional buffered Ca(2+) diffusion and binding to secretory and facilitation targets suggest that the facilitation site is located away from a secretory trigger mediating exocytosis; otherwise, the facilitation site would be saturated by each action potential. Our simulations account for many characteristics of facilitation and effects of exogenous buffer, and suggest that facilitation is caused by residual calcium gaining access to a site distinct from the secretory trigger through restricted diffusion.},

In the present study, we have developed a series of IP(3) biosensors that exhibit strong pH stability and varying affinities for IP(3), as well as a method for the quantitative measurement of cytosolic concentrations of IP(3) ([IP(3)](i)) in single living cells. We applied this method to elucidate IP(3) dynamics during agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations, and demonstrated cell type-dependent differences in IP(3) dynamics; a non-fluctuating rise in [IP(3)](i) and repetitive IP(3) spikes during Ca(2+) oscillations in COS-7 cells and HSY-EA1 cells, respectively. The size of the IP(3) spikes in HSY-EA1 cells varied from 10 to 100 nM, and the [IP(3)](i) spike peak was preceded by a Ca(2+) spike peak. These results suggest that repetitive IP(3) spikes in HSY-EA1 cells are passive reflections of Ca(2+) oscillations, and are unlikely to be essential for driving Ca(2+) oscillations. The novel method described herein as well as the quantitative information obtained by using this method should provide a valuable and sound basis for future studies on the spatial and temporal regulations of IP(3) and Ca(2+).},

IP(3) promotes channel opening by controlling whether Ca(2+) binds to the stimulatory or inhibitory sites. The stimulatory site is probably an integral part of the receptor lying just upstream of the pore region. Inhibition of IP(3) receptors by Ca(2+) probably requires an accessory protein, which has not yet been unequivocally identified, but calmodulin is a prime candidate.

Several types of pituitary cells produce short bursts of electrical activity which are more effective than single spikes in evoking hormone release. These bursts, called pseudo-plateau bursts, are unlike bursts studied mathematically in neurons (plateau bursting) and the standard fast-slow analysis used for plateau bursting is of limited use. Using an alternative fast-slow analysis, with one fast and two slow variables, we show that pseudo-plateau bursting is a canard-induced mixed mode oscillation. Using this technique, it is possible to determine the region of parameter space where bursting occurs as well as salient properties of the burst such as the number of spikes in the burst.

The technique of fast/slow analysis, which takes advantage of time scale differences, is typically used to analyze the dynamics of bursting in mathematical models. Two classes of bursting oscillations that have been identified with this technique, plateau and pseudo-plateau bursting, are often observed in neurons and endocrine cells, respectively. These two types of bursting have very different properties and likely serve different functions. This latter point is supported by the divergent expression of the bursting patterns into different cell types, and raises the question of whether it is even possible for a model for one type of cell to produce bursting of the type seen in the other type without large changes to the model. Using fast/slow analysis, we show here that this is possible, and we provide a procedure for achieving this transition. This suggests that the design principles for bursting in endocrine cells are just quantitative variations of those for bursting in neurons.},

	Abstract = {Bursting oscillations in excitable systems reflect multi-timescale dynamics. These oscillations have often been studied in mathematical models by splitting the equations into fast and slow subsystems. Typically, one treats the slow variables as parameters of the fast subsystem and studies the bifurcation structure of this subsystem. This has key features such as a z-curve (stationary branch) and a Hopf bifurcation that gives rise to a branch of periodic spiking solutions. In models of bursting in pituitary cells, we have recently used a different approach that focuses on the dynamics of the slow subsystem. Characteristic features of this approach are folded node singularities and a critical manifold. In this article, we investigate the relationships between the key structures of the two analysis techniques. We find that the z-curve and Hopf bifurcation of the two-fast/one-slow decomposition are closely related to the voltage nullcline and folded node singularity of the one-fast/two-slow decomposition, respectively. They become identical in the double singular limit in which voltage is infinitely fast and calcium is infinitely slow.},

	Abstract = {Abstract  Agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in many cell types are triggered by Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores and driven by store-operated Ca(2+) entry. Stromal cell-interaction molecule (STIM) 1 and STIM2 serve as endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensors that, upon store depletion, activate Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channels (Orai1-3, CRACM1-3) in the plasma membrane. However, their relative roles in agonist-mediated Ca(2+) oscillations remain ambiguous. Here we report that while both STIM1 and STIM2 contribute to store-refilling during Ca(2+) oscillations in mast cells (RBL), T cells (Jurkat) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, they do so dependent on the level of store depletion. Molecular silencing of STIM2 by siRNA or inhibition by G418 suppresses store-operated Ca(2+) entry and agonist-mediated Ca(2+) oscillations at low levels of store depletion, without interfering with STIM1-mediated signals induced by full store depletion. Thus, STIM2 is preferentially activated by low-level physiological agonist concentrations that cause mild reductions in endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) levels. We conclude that with increasing agonist concentrations, store-operated Ca(2+) entry is mediated initially by endogenous STIM2 and incrementally by STIM1, enabling differential modulation of Ca(2+) entry over a range of agonist concentrations and levels of store depletion.},

	Abstract = {Cytosolic Ca2+ signals are often organized in complex temporal and spatial patterns, even under conditions of sustained stimulation. In this review we discuss the mechanisms and physiological significance of this behavior in nonexcitable cells, in which the primary mechanism of Ca2+ mobilization is through (1,4,5)IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Oscillations of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) are a common form of temporal organization; in the spatial domain, these [Ca2+]i oscillations may take the form of [Ca2+]i waves that propagate throughout the cell or they may be restricted to specific subcellular regions. These patterns of Ca2+ signaling result from the limited range of cytoplasmic Ca2+ diffusion and the feedback regulation of the pathways responsible for Ca2+ mobilization. In addition, the spatial organization of [Ca2+]i changes appears to depend on the strategic distribution of Ca2+ stores within the cell. One type of [Ca2+]i oscillation is baseline spiking, in which discrete [Ca2+]i spikes occur with a frequency, but not amplitude, that is determined by agonist dose. Most current evidence favors a model in which baseline [Ca2+]i spiking results from the complex interplay between [Ca2+]i and (1,4,5)IP3 in regulating the gating of (1,4,5)IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ channels. Sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations represent a mechanistically distinct type of temporal organization, in which agonist dose regulates the amplitude but has no effect on oscillation frequency. Sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations can be explained by a negative feedback effect of protein kinase C on the generation of (1,4,5)IP3 at the level of phospholipase C or its activating G-protein. The physiological significance of [Ca2+]i oscillations and waves is becoming more established with the observation of this behavior in intact tissues and by the recognition of Ca2+-dependent processes that are adapted to respond to frequency-modulated oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals. In some cells, these [Ca2+]i signals are targeted to control processes in limited cytoplasmic domains, and in other systems [Ca2+]i waves can be propagated through gap junctions to coordinate the function of multicellular systems.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elementary Ca2+ signals, such as 'Ca2+ puffs', that arise from the activation of clusters of inositol 1 ,4,5,-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors are the building blocks for local and global Ca2+ signalling. We previously found that one, or a few, Ca2+ puff sites within agonist-stimulated cells act as 'pacemakers' to initiate global Ca2+ waves. The factors that distinguish these pacemaker Ca2+ puff sites from the other Ca2+ release sites that simply participate in Ca2+ wave propagation are unknown. RESULTS: The spatiotemporal properties of Ca2+ puffs were investigated using confocal microscopy of fluo3-loaded HeLa cells. The same pacemaker Ca2+ puff sites were activated during stimulation of cells with different agonists. The majority of agonist-stimulated pacemaker Ca2+ puffs originated in a perinuclear location. The positions of such Ca2+ puff sites were stable for up to 2 hours, and were not affected by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. A similar perinuclear distribution of Ca2+ puff sites was also observed when InsP3 receptors were directly stimulated with thimerosal or membrane-permeant InsP3 esters. Immunostaining indicated that the perinuclear position of pacemaker Ca2+ puffs was not due to the localised expression of InsP3 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: The pacemaker Ca2+ puff sites that initiate Ca2+ responses are temporally and spatially stable within cells. These Ca2+ release sites are distinguished from their neighbours by an intrinsically higher InsP3 sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {Submaximal stimulation with agonists generating inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (IP3) evokes cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in many different cell types. In general, each Ca2+ rise is initiated from a specific region near the plasma membrane and then spreads as a wave throughout the cell. We now demonstrate that low (physiological) agonist concentrations evoke local cytosolic Ca2+ spikes in the secretory pole of single mouse pancreatic acinar cells that are particularly sensitive to blockade by the IP3 receptor antagonist heparin. These spikes can occur alone or repetitively or can precede longer lasting Ca2+ signals that spread throughout the cell. Intracellular IP3 application mimics these agonist actions. The short- lasting local Ca2+ spikes provide an economical signaling mechanism and are of physiological significance since they activate Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- and cation currents important for control of fluid secretion.},

	Abstract = {We simulate currents and concentration profiles generated by Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol through IP(3) receptor channel clusters. Clusters are described as conducting pores in the lumenal membrane with a diameter from 6 nm to 36 nm. The endoplasmic reticulum is modeled as a disc with a radius of 1-12 microm and an inner height of 28 nm. We adapt the dependence of the currents on the trans Ca(2+) concentration (intralumenal) measured in lipid bilayer experiments to the cellular geometry. Simulated currents are compared with signal mass measurements in Xenopus oocytes. We find that release currents depend linearly on the concentration of free Ca(2+) in the lumen. The release current is approximately proportional to the square root of the number of open channels in a cluster. Cytosolic concentrations at the location of the cluster range from 25 microM to 170 microM. Concentration increase due to puffs in a distance of a few micrometers from the puff site is found to be in the nanomolar range. Release currents decay biexponentially with timescales of <1 s and a few seconds. Concentration profiles decay with timescales of 0.125-0.250 s upon termination of release.},

	Abstract = {Changes in cellular Ca2+ concentration control a wide range of physiological processes, from the subsecond release of synaptic neurotransmitters, to the regulation of gene expression over months or years. Ca2+ can also trigger cell death through both apoptosis and necrosis, and so the regulation of cellular Ca2+ concentration must be tightly controlled through the concerted action of pumps, channels and buffers that transport Ca2+ into and out of the cell cytoplasm. A hallmark of cellular Ca2+ signalling is its spatiotemporal complexity: stimulation of cells by a hormone or neurotransmitter leads to oscillations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration that can vary markedly in time course, amplitude, frequency, and spatial range. In this chapter we review some of the biological roles of Ca2+, the experimental characterisation of complex dynamic changes in Ca2+ concentration, and attempts to explain this complexity using computational models. We consider the 'toolkit' of cellular proteins which influence Ca2+ concentrarion, describe mechanistic models of key elements of the toolkit, and fit these into the framework of whole cell models of Ca2+ oscillations and waves. Finally, we will touch on recent efforts to use stochastic modelling to elucidate elementary Ca2+ signal events, and how these may evolve into global signals.},

	Abstract = {Clusters of ryanodine receptors within atrial myocytes are confined to spatially separated layers. In many species, these layers are not juxtaposed by invaginations of the plasma membrane (transverse tubules; 'T-tubules'), so that calcium-induced-calcium signals rely on centripetal propagation rather than voltage-synchronized channel openings to invade the interior of the cell and trigger contraction. The combination of this specific cellular geometry and dynamics of calcium release can lead to novel autonomous spatio-temporal calcium waves, and in particular ping waves. These are waves of calcium release activity that spread as counter-rotating sectors of elevated calcium within a single layer of ryanodine receptors, and can seed further longitudinal calcium waves. Here we show, using a computational model, that these calcium waves can dominate the response of a cell to electrical pacing and hence are pro-arrhythmic. This highlights the importance of modeling internal cellular structures when investigating mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction such as atrial arrhythmia.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we present an innovative mathematical modeling approach that allows detailed characterization of Ca(2+) movement within the three-dimensional volume of an atrial myocyte. Essential aspects of the model are the geometrically realistic representation of Ca(2+) release sites and physiological Ca(2+) flux parameters, coupled with a computationally inexpensive framework. By translating nonlinear Ca(2+) excitability into threshold dynamics, we avoid the computationally demanding time stepping of the partial differential equations that are often used to model Ca(2+) transport. Our approach successfully reproduces key features of atrial myocyte Ca(2+) signaling observed using confocal imaging. In particular, the model displays the centripetal Ca(2+) waves that occur within atrial myocytes during excitation-contraction coupling, and the effect of positive inotropic stimulation on the spatial profile of the Ca(2+) signals. Beyond this validation of the model, our simulation reveals unexpected observations about the spread of Ca(2+) within an atrial myocyte. In particular, the model describes the movement of Ca(2+) between ryanodine receptor clusters within a specific z disk of an atrial myocyte. Furthermore, we demonstrate that altering the strength of Ca(2+) release, ryanodine receptor refractoriness, the magnitude of initiating stimulus, or the introduction of stochastic Ca(2+) channel activity can cause the nucleation of proarrhythmic traveling Ca(2+) waves. The model provides clinically relevant insights into the initiation and propagation of subcellular Ca(2+) signals that are currently beyond the scope of imaging technology.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) is a universal second messenger in eukaryotic cells transmitting information through sequences of concentration spikes. A prominent mechanism to generate these spikes involves Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) store via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-sensitive channels. Puffs are elemental events of IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release through single clusters of channels. Intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics are a stochastic system, but a complete stochastic theory has not been developed yet. We formulate the theory in terms of interpuff interval and puff duration distributions because, unlike the properties of individual channels, they can be measured in vivo. Our theory reproduces the typical spectrum of Ca(2+) signals like puffs, spiking, and bursting in analytically treatable test cases as well as in more realistic simulations. We find conditions for spiking and calculate interspike interval (ISI) distributions. Signal form, average ISI and ISI distributions depend sensitively on the details of cluster properties and their spatial arrangement. In contrast to that, the relation between the average and the standard deviation of ISIs does not depend on cluster properties and cluster arrangement and is robust with respect to cell variability. It is controlled by the global feedback processes in the Ca(2+) signaling pathway (e.g., via IP(3)-3-kinase or endoplasmic reticulum depletion). That relation is essential for pathway function because it ensures frequency encoding despite the randomness of ISIs and determines the maximal spike train information content. Hence, we find a division of tasks between global feedbacks and local cluster properties that guarantees robustness of function while maintaining sensitivity of control of the average ISI.},

Ca(2+) signaling by inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)R) offers an opportunity to understand this relationship because the cellular behavior is defined largely by Ca(2+)-mediated interactions between IP(3)R. Ca(2+) released by a cluster of IP(3)R (giving a local Ca(2+) puff) diffuses and ignites the behavior of neighboring clusters (to give repetitive global Ca(2+) spikes). We use total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of two mammalian cell lines to define the temporal relationships between Ca(2+) puffs (interpuff intervals, IPI) and Ca(2+) spikes (interspike intervals) evoked by flash photolysis of caged IP(3). We find that IPI are much shorter than interspike intervals, that puff activity is stochastic with a recovery time that is much shorter than the refractory period of the cell, and that IPI are not periodic. We conclude that Ca(2+) spikes do not arise from oscillatory dynamics of IP(3)R clusters, but that repetitive Ca(2+) spiking with its longer timescales is an emergent property of the dynamics of the whole cluster array.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ca(2+) is a ubiquitous and versatile second messenger that transmits information through changes of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. Recent investigations changed basic ideas on the dynamic character of Ca(2+) signals and challenge traditional ideas on information transmission. SCOPE OF REVIEW: We present recent findings on key characteristics of the cytosolic Ca(2+) dynamics and theoretical concepts that explain the wide range of experimentally observed Ca(2+) signals. Further, we relate properties of the dynamical regulation of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration to ideas about information transmission by stochastic signals. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the importance of the hierarchal arrangement of Ca(2+) release sites on the emergence of cellular Ca(2+) spikes. Stochastic Ca(2+) signals are functionally robust and adaptive to changing environmental conditions. Fluctuations of interspike intervals (ISIs) and the moment relation derived from ISI distributions contain information on the channel cluster open probability and on pathway properties. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Robust and reliable signal transduction pathways that entail Ca(2+) dynamics are essential for eukaryotic organisms. Moreover, we expect that the design of a stochastic mechanism which provides robustness and adaptivity will be found also in other biological systems. Ca(2+) dynamics demonstrate that the fluctuations of cellular signals contain information on molecular behavior.

	Abstract = {Agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca(2+) spikes in mouse pancreatic acinar cells are specifically initiated in the apical secretory pole and are mostly confined to this region. The role played by mitochondria in this process has been investigated. Using the mitochondria-specific fluorescent dyes MitoTracker Green and Rhodamine 123, these organelles appeared as a bright belt concentrated mainly around the secretory granule area. We tested the effects of two different types of mitochondrial inhibitor on the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration using simultaneous imaging of Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescence (Fura 2) and electrophysiology. When carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was applied in the presence of the Ca(2+)-releasing messenger inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), the local repetitive Ca(2+) responses in the granule area were transformed into a global rise in the cellular Ca(2+) concentration. In the absence of IP(3), CCCP had no effect on the cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. Antimycin and antimycin + oligomycin had the same effect as CCCP. Active mitochondria, strategically placed around the secretory pole, block Ca(2+) diffusion from the primary Ca(2+) release sites in the granule-rich area in the apical pole to the basal part of the cell containing the nucleus. When mitochondrial function is inhibited, this barrier disappears and the Ca(2+) signals spread all over the cytosol.},

	Abstract = {Cell responses are commonly heterogeneous, even within a subpopulation. In the present study, we investigate the source of heterogeneity in the Ca(2+) response of anterior pituitary lactotrophs to a Ca(2+) mobilisation agonist, thyrotrophin-releasing hormone. This response is characterised by a sharp increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration as a result of mobilisation of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores, followed by a decrease to an elevated plateau level that results from Ca(2+) influx. We focus on heterogeneity of the evoked Ca(2+) spike under extracellular Ca(2+) free conditions. We introduce a method that uses the information provided by a mathematical model to characterise the source of heterogeneity. This method compares scatter plots of features of the Ca(2+) response obtained experimentally with those made from the mathematical model. The model scatter plots reflect random variation of parameters over different ranges, and matching the experimental and model scatter plots allows us to predict which parameters are most variable. We find that a large degree of variation in Ca(2+) efflux is a likely key contributor to the heterogeneity of Ca(2+) responses to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone in lactotrophs. This technique is applicable to any situation in which the heterogeneous biological response is described by a mathematical model.},

	Abstract = {Calcium-mobilizing agonists induce intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes thought to trigger cellular responses. In connected cells, rises in [Ca2+]i can propagate from cell to cell as intercellular Ca2+ waves, the mechanisms of which are not elucidated. Using fura2-loaded rat hepatocytes, we studied the mechanisms controlling coordination and intercellular propagation of noradrenaline- induced Ca2+ signals. Gap junction blockade with 18 alpha- glycyrrhetinic acid resulted in a loss of coordination between connected cells. We found that second messengers and [Ca2+]i rises in one hepatocyte cannot trigger Ca2+ responses in connected cells, suggesting that diffusion across gap junctions, while required for coordination, is not sufficient by itself for the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves. In addition, our experiments revealed functional differences between noradrenaline-induced Ca2+ signals in connected hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that intercellular Ca2+ signals in multicellular systems of rat hepatocytes are propagated and highly organized through complex mechanisms involving at least three factors. First, gap junction coupling ensures coordination of [Ca2+]i oscillations between the different cells; second, the presence of hormone at each hepatocyte is required for cell-cell Ca2+ signal propagation; and third, functional differences between adjacent connected hepatocytes could allow a 'pacemaker-like' intercellular spread of Ca2+ waves.},

The mechanisms initiating intercellular Ca2+ waves in one cell and determining their direction are unknown. We investigated these mechanisms directly on fura2-loaded multicellular systems of rat hepatocytes and on cell populations issued from peripheral (periportal) and central (perivenous) parts of the hepatic lobule. There was a gradient in vasopressin sensitivity along connected cells as demonstrated by low vasopressin concentration challenge. Interestingly, the intercellular sensitivity gradient was abolished either when D-myo-inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor was directly stimulated after flash photolysis of caged InsP3 or when G proteins were directly stimulated with AlF4-. The gradient in vasopressin sensitivity in multiplets was correlated with a heterogeneity of vasopressin sensitivity in the hepatic lobule. There were more vasopressin-binding sites, vasopressin-induced InsP3 production and V1a vasopressin receptor mRNAs in perivenous than in periportal cells. Therefore, we propose that hormone receptor density determines the cellular sensitivity gradient from the peripheral to the central zones of the liver cell plate, thus the starting cell and the direction of intercellular Ca2+ waves, leading to directional activation of Ca2+-dependent processes.},

	Abstract = {We present a biophysically based kinetic model of the cardiac SERCA pump that consolidates a range of experimental data into a consistent and thermodynamically constrained framework. The SERCA model consists of a number of sub-states with partial reactions that are sensitive to Ca(2+) and pH, and to the metabolites MgATP, MgADP, and Pi. Optimization of model parameters to fit experimental data favors a fully cooperative Ca(2+)-binding mechanism and predicts a Ca(2+)/H(+) counter-transport stoichiometry of 2. Moreover, the order of binding of the partial reactions, particularly the binding of MgATP, proves to be a strong determinant of the ability of the model to fit the data. A thermodynamic investigation of the model indicates that the binding of MgATP has a large inhibitory effect on the maximal reverse rate of the pump. The model is suitable for integrating into whole-cell models of cardiac electrophysiology and Ca(2+) dynamics to simulate the effects on the cell of compromised metabolism arising in ischemia and hypoxia.},

	Abstract = {Calcium buffers are large proteins that act as binding sites for free cytosolic calcium. Since a large fraction of cytosolic calcium is bound to calcium buffers, calcium waves are widely observed under the condition that free cytosolic calcium is heavily buffered. In addition, all physiological buffered excitable systems contain multiple buffers with different affinities. It is thus important to understand the properties of waves in excitable systems with the inclusion of buffers. There is an ongoing controversy about whether or not the addition of calcium buffers into the system always slows down the propagation of calcium waves. To solve this controversy, we incorporate the buffering effect into the generic excitable system, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, to get the buffered FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and then to study the effect of the added buffer with large diffusivity on traveling waves of such a model in one spatial dimension. We can find a critical dissociation constant (K = K(a)) characterized by system excitability parameter a such that calcium buffers can be classified into two types: weak buffers (K ∈ (K(a), ∞)) and strong buffers (K ∈ (0, K(a))). We analytically show that the addition of weak buffers or strong buffers but with its total concentration b(0)(1) below some critical total concentration b(0,c)(1) into the system can generate a traveling wave of the resulting system which propagates faster than that of the origin system, provided that the diffusivity D1 of the added buffers is sufficiently large. Further, the magnitude of the wave speed of traveling waves of the resulting system is proportional to √D1 as D1 --> ∞. In contrast, the addition of strong buffers with the total concentration b(0)(1) > b(0,c)(1) into the system may not be able to support the formation of a biologically acceptable wave provided that the diffusivity D1 of the added buffers is sufficiently large.},

	Abstract = {We use a mathematical model of calcium dynamics in pancreatic acinar cells to investigate calcium oscillations in a ring of three coupled cells. A connected group of cells is modeled in two different ways: 1), as coupled point oscillators, each oscillator being described by a spatially homogeneous model; and 2), as spatially distributed cells coupled along their common boundaries by gap-junctional diffusion of inositol trisphosphate and/or calcium. We show that, although the point-oscillator model gives a reasonably accurate general picture, the behavior of the spatially distributed cells cannot always be predicted from the simpler analysis; spatially distributed diffusion and cell geometry both play important roles in determining behavior. In particular, oscillations in which two cells are in synchrony, with the third phase-locked but not synchronous, appears to be more dominant in the spatially distributed model than in the point-oscillator model. In both types of model, intercellular coupling leads to a variety of synchronous, phase-locked, or asynchronous behaviors. For some parameter values there are multiple, simultaneous stable types of oscillation. We predict 1), that intercellular calcium diffusion is necessary and sufficient to coordinate the responses in neighboring cells; 2), that the function of intercellular inositol trisphosphate diffusion is to smooth out any concentration differences between the cells, thus making it easier for the diffusion of calcium to synchronize the oscillations; 3), that groups of coupled cells will tend to respond in a clumped manner, with groups of synchronized cells, rather than with regular phase-locked periodic intercellular waves; and 4), that enzyme secretion is maximized by the presence of a pacemaker cell in each cluster which drives the other cells at a frequency greater than their intrinsic frequency.},

	Abstract = {Cell coupling is important for the normal function of the beta-cells of the pancreatic islet of Langerhans, which secrete insulin in response to elevated plasma glucose. In the islets, electrical and metabolic communications are mediated by gap junctions. Although electrical coupling is believed to account for synchronization of the islets, the role and significance of diffusion of calcium and metabolites are not clear. To address these questions we analyze two different mathematical models of islet calcium and electrical dynamics. To study diffusion of calcium, we use a modified Morris-Lecar model. Based on our analysis, we conclude that intercellular diffusion of calcium is not necessary for islet synchronization, at most supplementing electrical coupling. Metabolic coupling is investigated with a recent mathematical model incorporating glycolytic oscillations. Bifurcation analysis of the coupled system reveals several modes of behavior, depending on the relative strength of electrical and metabolic coupling. We find that whereas electrical coupling always produces synchrony, metabolic coupling can abolish both oscillations and synchrony, explaining some puzzling experimental observations. We suggest that these modes are generic features of square-wave bursters and relaxation oscillators coupled through either the activation or recovery variable.},

	Abstract = {Cultured pituitary somatotrophs release growth hormone in response to spontaneous Ca(2+) entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) that is governed by plateau-bursting electrical activity and is regulated by several neurohormones, including GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin. Here we combine experiments and theory to clarify the mechanisms underlying spontaneous and receptor-controlled electrical activity. Experiments support a role of a Na(+)-conducting and tetrodotoxin-insensitive channel in controlling spontaneous and GHRH-stimulated pacemaking, the latter in a cAMP-dependent manner; an opposing role of spontaneously active inwardly rectifying K(+) (K(ir)) channels and G-protein-regulated K(ir) channels in somatostatin-mediated inhibition of pacemaking; as well as a role of VGCCs in spiking and large conductance (BK-type) Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels in plateau bursting. The mathematical model is compatible with a wide variety of experimental data involving pharmacology and extracellular ion substitution and supports the importance of constitutively active tetrodotoxin-insensitive Na(+) and K(ir) channels in maintaining spontaneous pacemaking in pituitary somatotrophs. The model also suggests that these channels are involved in the up- and downregulation of electrical activity by GHRH and somatostatin. In the model, the plateau bursting is controlled by two functional populations of BK channels, characterized by distance from the VGCCs. The rapid activation of the proximal BK channels is critical for the establishment of the plateau, whereas slow recruitment of the distal BK channels terminates the plateau.},

	Abstract = {Plateau bursting is typical of many electrically excitable cells, such as endocrine cells that secrete hormones and some types of neurons that secrete neurotransmitters. Although in many of these cell types the bursting patterns are regulated by the interplay between voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium-sensitive potassium channels, they can be very different. We investigate so-called square-wave and pseudo-plateau bursting patterns found in endocrine cell models that are characterized by a super- or subcritical Hopf bifurcation in the fast subsystem, respectively. By using the polynomial model of Hindmarsh and Rose (Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 221 (1222) 87-102), which preserves the main properties of the biophysical class of models that we consider, we perform a detailed bifurcation analysis of the full fast-slow system for both bursting patterns. We find that both cases lead to the same possibility of two routes to bursting, that is, the criticality of the Hopf bifurcation is not relevant for characterizing the route to bursting. The actual route depends on the relative location of the full-system's fixed point with respect to a homoclinic bifurcation of the fast subsystem. Our full-system bifurcation analysis reveals properties of endocrine bursting that are not captured by the standard fast-slow analysis.},

	Abstract = {Calcium is a universal signaling molecule with a central role in a number of vascular functions including in the regulation of tone and blood flow. Experimentation has provided insights into signaling pathways that lead to or affected by Ca(2+) mobilization in the vasculature. Mathematical modeling offers a systematic approach to the analysis of these mechanisms and can serve as a tool for data interpretation and for guiding new experimental studies. Comprehensive models of calcium dynamics are well advanced for some systems such as the heart. This review summarizes the progress that has been made in modeling Ca(2+) dynamics and signaling in vascular cells. Model simulations show how Ca(2+) signaling emerges as a result of complex, nonlinear interactions that cannot be properly analyzed using only a reductionist's approach. A strategy of integrative modeling in the vasculature is outlined that will allow linking macroscale pathophysiological responses to the underlying cellular mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ is a fundamental intracellular signal that mediates a variety of disparate physiological functions often in the same cell. Ca2+ signals span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, which endow them with the specificity required to induce defined cellular functions. Furthermore, Ca2+ signaling is highly plastic as it is modulated dynamically during normal physiological development and under pathological conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Ca2+ signaling differentiation during cellular development remain poorly understood. Oocyte maturation in preparation for fertilization provides an exceptionally well-suited model to elucidate Ca2+ signaling regulation during cellular development. This is because a Ca2+ signal with specialized spatial and temporal dynamics is universally essential for egg activation at fertilization. Here we use mathematical modeling to define the critical determinants of Ca2+ signaling differentiation during oocyte maturation. We show that increasing IP3 receptor (IP3R) affinity replicates both elementary and global Ca2+ dynamics observed experimentally following oocyte maturation. Furthermore, our model reveals that because of the Ca2+ dependency of both SERCA and the IP3R, increased IP3R affinity shifts the system's equilibrium to a new steady state of high cytosolic Ca2+, which is essential for fertilization. Therefore our model provides unique insights into how relatively small alterations of the basic molecular mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling components can lead to dramatic alterations in the spatio-temporal properties of Ca2+ dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in excitable cells often acts as a negative feedback signal on firing of action potentials and the associated voltage-gated Ca2+ influx. Increased [Ca2+]i stimulates Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels (IK-Ca), and this, in turn, hyperpolarizes the cell and inhibits Ca2+ influx. However, in some cells expressing IK-Ca the elevation in [Ca2+]i by depletion of intracellular stores facilitates voltage-gated Ca2+ influx. This phenomenon was studied in hypothalamic GT1 neuronal cells during store depletion caused by activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors and inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+)ATPase with thapsigargin. GnRH induced a rapid spike increase in [Ca2+]i accompanied by transient hyperpolarization, followed by a sustained [Ca2+]i plateau during which the depolarized cells fired with higher frequency. The transient hyperpolarization was caused by the initial spike in [Ca2+]i and was mediated by apamin-sensitive IK-Ca channels, which also were operative during the subsequent depolarization phase. Agonist-induced depolarization and increased firing were independent of [Ca2+]i and were not mediated by inhibition of K+ current, but by facilitation of a voltage-insensitive, Ca2+-conducting inward current. Store depletion by thapsigargin also activated this inward depolarizing current and increased the firing frequency. Thus, the pattern of firing in GT1 neurons is regulated coordinately by apamin-sensitive SK current and store depletion-activated Ca2+ current. This dual control of pacemaker activity facilitates voltage-gated Ca2+ influx at elevated [Ca2+]i levels, but also protects cells from Ca2+ overload. This process may also provide a general mechanism for the integration of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx into receptor-controlled Ca2+ mobilization.},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors are expressed in hypothalamic tissues from adult rats, cultured fetal hypothalamic cells, and immortalized GnRH-secreting neurons (GT1 cells). Their activation by GnRH agonists leads to an overall increase in the extracellular Ca2+-dependent pulsatile release of GnRH. Electrophysiological studies showed that GT1 cells exhibit spontaneous, extracellular Ca2+-dependent action potentials, and that their inward currents include Na+, T-type and L-type Ca2+ components. Several types of potassium channels, including apamin-sensitive Ca2+-controlled potassium (SK) channels, are also expressed in GT1 cells. Activation of GnRH receptors leads to biphasic changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), with an early and extracellular Ca2+-independent peak and a sustained and extracellular Ca2+-dependent plateau phase. During the peak [Ca2+]i response, electrical activity is abolished due to transient hyperpolarization that is mediated by SK channels. This is followed by sustained depolarization and resumption of firing with increased spike frequency and duration. The agonist-induced depolarization and increased firing are independent of [Ca2+]i and are not mediated by inhibition of K+ currents, but by facilitation of a voltage-insensitive and store depletion-activated Ca2+-conducting inward current. The dual control of pacemaker activity by SK and store depletion-activated Ca2+ channels facilitates voltage-gated Ca2+ influx at elevated [Ca2+]i levels, but also protects cells from Ca2+ overload. This process accounts for the autoregulatory action of GnRH on its release from hypothalamic neurons.},

J. 85: 1392-1405, 2003]. Since it is known that two principal calcium release pathways are involved, inositol trisphosphate receptors (IPR) and ryanodine receptors (RyR), we study how the model behavior depends on the density of each receptor type. Calcium oscillations can be mediated either by IPR or RyR. Continuous increases in either RyR or IPR density can lead to the appearance and disappearance of oscillations multiple times, and the two receptor types interact via their common effect on cytoplasmic calcium concentration and the subsequent effect on the total amount of calcium inside the cell. Increases in agonist concentration can stimulate oscillations via the RyR by increasing calcium influx. Using a two time-scale approach, we explain these complex behaviors by treating the total amount of cellular calcium as a slow parameter. Oscillations are controlled by the shape of the slow manifold and where it intersects the nullcline of the slow variable. When calcium diffusion is included, the existence of traveling waves in the model equation is strongly dependent on the interplay between the total amount of calcium in the cell and membrane transport, a feature that can be experimentally tested. Our results help us understand the behavior of a model that includes both receptors in comparison to the properties of each receptor type in isolation.},

	Abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The mechanisms by which glucose regulates glucagon release are poorly understood. The present study aimed to clarify the direct effects of glucose on the glucagon-releasing alpha cells and those effects mediated by paracrine islet factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Glucagon, insulin and somatostatin release were measured from incubated mouse pancreatic islets and the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) recorded in isolated mouse alpha cells.
RESULTS: Glucose inhibited glucagon release with maximal effect at 7 mmol/l. Since this concentration corresponded to threshold stimulation of insulin secretion, it is unlikely that inhibition of glucagon secretion is mediated by beta cell factors. Although somatostatin secretion data seemed consistent with a role of this hormone in glucose-inhibited glucagon release, a somatostatin receptor type 2 antagonist stimulated glucagon release without diminishing the inhibitory effect of glucose. In islets exposed to tolbutamide plus 8 mmol/l K(+), glucose inhibited glucagon secretion without stimulating the release of insulin and somatostatin, indicating a direct inhibitory effect on the alpha cells that was independent of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels. Glucose lowered [Ca(2+)](i) of individual alpha cells independently of somatostatin and beta cell factors (insulin, Zn(2+) and gamma-aminobutyric acid). Glucose suppression of glucagon release was prevented by inhibitors of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, which abolished the [Ca(2+)](i)-lowering effect of glucose on isolated alpha cells.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Beta cell factors or somatostatin do not seem to mediate glucose inhibition of glucagon secretion. We instead propose that glucose has a direct inhibitory effect on mouse alpha cells by suppressing a depolarising Ca(2+) store-operated current.},

	Abstract = {We combine bifurcation analysis with the theory of canard-induced mixed mode oscillations to investigate the dynamics of a novel form of bursting. This bursting oscillation, which arises from a model of the electrical activity of a pituitary cell, is characterized by small impulses or spikes riding on top of an elevated voltage plateau. Oscillations with these characteristics have been called "pseudo-plateau bursting". Unlike standard bursting, the subsystem of fast variables does not possess a stable branch of periodic spiking solutions, and in the case studied here the standard fast/slow analysis provides little information about the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate that the bursting is actually a canard-induced mixed mode oscillation, and use canard theory to characterize the dynamics of the oscillation. We also use bifurcation analysis of the full system of equations to extend the results of the singular analysis to the physiological regime. This demonstrates that the combination of these two analysis techniques can be a powerful tool for understanding the pseudo-plateau bursting oscillations that arise in electrically excitable pituitary cells and isolated pancreatic beta-cells.},

	Abstract = {The electrical activity of endocrine pituitary cells is mediated by a plethora of ionic currents and establishing the role of a single channel type is difficult. Experimental observations have shown however that fast-activating voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium (BK) current tends to promote bursting in pituitary cells. This burst promoting effect requires fast activation of the BK current, otherwise it is inhibitory to bursting. In this work, we analyze a pituitary cell model in order to answer the question of why the BK activation must be fast to promote bursting. We also examine how the interplay between the activation rate and conductance of the BK current shapes the bursting activity. We use the multiple timescale structure of the model to our advantage and employ geometric singular perturbation theory to demonstrate the origin of the bursting behaviour. In particular, we show that the bursting can arise from either canard dynamics or slow passage through a dynamic Hopf bifurcation. We then compare our theoretical predictions with experimental data using the dynamic clamp technique and find that the data is consistent with a burst mechanism due to a slow passage through a Hopf.},

	Abstract = {Many neurosecretory preparations display two components of depolarization-induced exocytosis: a phasic component synchronized with Ca2+ channel opening, followed by a slower sustained component. We evaluated possible mechanisms underlying this biphasic behavior by stimulating mouse chromaffin cells in situ with both depolarizations and flash photolysis of caged Ca2+. From a direct comparison of the secretory responses to both stimuli, we conclude that phasic and sustained release components originate from a readily releasable pool (RRP) of equally fusion-competent vesicles, suggesting that differences in the vesicles' proximity to Ca2+ channels underlie the biphasic secretory behavior. An intermediate pool in dynamic equilibrium with the RRP ensures rapid recruitment of release-ready vesicles after RRP depletion. Our results are discussed in terms of a refined model for secretion in chromaffin cells.},

Here, a novel approach was developed to control [Ca2+]i over a broad concentration range, which allowed the quantification of three distinct actions of [Ca2+]i on large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) fusion in chromaffin cells from mouse adrenal slices. Basal [Ca2+]i regulated the transfer of vesicles toward a slowly releasable state, whereas further maturation to the readily releasable state was Ca2+ independent. [Ca2+]i levels above 3 microM triggered exocytosis of all readily and slowly releasable vesicles in two parallel, kinetically distinct fusion reactions. In a molecular context, these results suggest that Ca2+ acts both before and after trans-SNARE complex formation to regulate fusion competence and fusion kinetics of LDCVs.},

	Abstract = {In order to release neurotransmitter synchronously in response to a presynaptic action potential, synaptic vesicles must be both release competent and located close to presynaptic Ca2+ channels. It has not been shown, however, which of the two is the more decisive factor. We tested this issue at the calyx of Held synapse by combining Ca2+ uncaging and electrophysiological measurements of postsynaptic responses. After depletion of the synaptic vesicles that are responsible for synchronous release during action potentials, uniform elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by Ca2+ uncaging could still elicit rapid release. The Ca2+ sensitivity of remaining vesicles was reduced no more than 2-fold, which is insufficient to explain the slow-down of the kinetics of release (10-fold) observed during a depolarizing pulse. We conclude that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to sites where Ca2+ channels cluster, rather than fusion competence, is a limiting step for rapid neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic action potentials.},

In order to help interpret their results, we develop here a computational technique based on the finite element method that allows us to carry out realistic simulations of the fertilization wave. Our simulations support the hypothesis that the physiological state of the mature egg is bistable, i.e., that its cytoplasm can accommodate two alternative physiological Ca2+ concentrations: a low concentration characteristic of the prefertilization state and a greatly elevated concentration characteristic of the state following the passage of the wave. We explore this hypothesis by assuming that the bistability is due to the release and re-uptake properties of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as determined by inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor/Ca2+ channels and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps. When combined with buffered diffusion of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm, our simulations show that inhomogeneities in the Ca2+ release properties near the plasma membrane are required to explain the temporal and spatial dependences of the shape and speed of these waves. Our results are consistent with an elevated IP3 concentration near the plasma membrane in the unfertilized egg that is augmented significantly near the site of fertilization. These gradients are essential in determining the concave shape of the Ca2+ fertilization wave front.},

@article{wagner2004,
	Abstract = {The fertilization Ca2+ wave in Xenopus laevis is a single, large wave of elevated free Ca2+ that is initiated at the point of sperm-egg fusion and traverses the entire width of the egg. This Ca2+ wave involves an increase in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) resulting from the interaction of the sperm and egg, which then results in the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release machinery. The extraordinarily large size of this cell (1.2 mm diameter) together with the small surface region of sperm-receptor activation makes special demands on the IP3-dependent Ca2+ mobilizing machinery. We propose a detailed model of the fertilization Ca2+ wave in Xenopus eggs that requires an accompanying wave of IP3 production. While the Ca2+ wave is initiated by a localized increase of IP3 near the site of sperm-egg fusion, the Ca2+ wave propagates via IP3 production correlated with the Ca2+ wave-possibly via Ca(2+)-mediated PLC activation. Such a Ca(2+)-mediated IP(3) production wave has not been required previously to explain the fertilization Ca2+ wave in eggs; we argue this is necessary to explain the observed IP3 dynamics in Xenopus eggs. To test our hypothesis, we have measured the IP3 levels from 20 nl "sips" of the egg cortex during wave propagation. We were unable to detect the low IP3 levels in unfertilized eggs, but after fertilization, [IP3] ranged from 175 to 430 nM at the sperm entry point and from 120 to 700 nM 90 degrees away once the Ca2+ wave passed that region about 2 min after fertilization. Prior to the Ca2+ wave reaching that region the IP3 levels were undetectable. Since significant IP3 could not diffuse to this region from the sperm entry point within 2 min, this observation is consistent with a regenerative wave of IP3 production.},

	Abstract = {Phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)R) by PKA represents an important, common route for regulation of Ca(2+) release. Following phosphorylation of the S2 splice variant of InsP(3)R-1 (S2-InsP-1), Ca(2+) release is markedly potentiated. In this study we utilize the plasma membrane (PM) expression of InsP(3)R-1 and phosphorylation state mutant InsP(3)R-1 to study how this regulation occurs at the single InsP(3)R-1 channel level. DT40-3KO cells stably expressing rat S2- InsP(3)R-1 were generated and studied in the whole-cell mode of the patch clamp technique. At hyperpolarized holding potentials, small numbers of unitary currents (average approximately 1.7 per cell) were observed which were dependent on InsP(3) and the presence of functional InsP(3)R-1, and regulated by both cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and ATP. Raising cAMP markedly enhanced the open probability (P(o)) of the InsP(3)R-1 and induced bursting activity, characterized by extended periods of rapid channel openings and subsequent prolonged refractory periods. The activity, as measured by the P(o) of the channel, of a non-phosphorylatable InsP(3)R-1 construct (Ser1589Ala/Ser1755Ala InsP(3)R-1) was markedly less than wild-type (WT) InsP(3)R-1 and right shifted some approximately 15-fold when the concentration dependency was compared to a phosphomimetic construct (Ser1589Glu/Ser1755Glu InsP(3)R-1). No change in conductance of the channel was observed. This shift in apparent InsP(3) sensitivity occurred without a change in InsP(3) binding or Ca(2+) dependency of activation or inactivation. Biophysical analysis indicated that channel activity can be described by three states: an open state, a long lived closed state which manifests itself as long interburst intervals, and a short-lived closed state. Bursting activity occurs as the channel shuttles rapidly between the open and short-lived closed state. The predominant effect of InsP(3)R-1 phosphorylation is to increase the likelihood of extended bursting activity and thus markedly augment Ca(2+) release. These analyses provide insight into the mechanism responsible for augmenting InsP(3)R-1 channel activity following phosphorylation and moreover should be generally useful for further detailed investigation of the biophysical properties of InsP(3)R.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we provide the first description of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) expressed in a native membrane using the on-nucleus configuration of the patch clamp technique. A stable cell line expressing rabbit RyR1 was established (HEK-RyR1) using the FLP-in 293 cell system. In contrast to untransfected cells, RyR1 expression was readily demonstrated by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry in HEK-RyR1 cells. In addition, the RyR1 agonists 4-CMC and caffeine activated Ca(2+) release that was inhibited by high concentrations of ryanodine. On nucleus patch clamp was performed in nuclei prepared from HEK-RyR1 cells. Raising the [Ca(2+)] in the patch pipette resulted in the appearance of a large conductance cation channel with well resolved kinetics and the absence of prominent subconductance states. Current versus voltage relationships were ohmic and revealed a chord conductance of ∼750pS or 450pS in symmetrical 250mM KCl or CsCl, respectively. The channel activity was markedly enhanced by caffeine and exposure to ryanodine resulted in the appearance of a subconductance state with a conductance ∼40% of the full channel opening with a Po near unity. In total, these properties are entirely consistent with RyR1 channel activity. Exposure of RyR1 channels to cyclic ADP ribose (cADPr), nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or dantrolene did not alter the single channel activity stimulated by Ca(2+), and thus, it is unlikely these molecules directly modulate RyR1 channel activity. In summary, we describe an experimental platform to monitor the single channel properties of RyR channels. We envision that this system will be influential in characterizing disease-associated RyR mutations and the molecular determinants of RyR channel modulation.},

	Abstract = {Stable calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) is critical for maintaining normal cellular contraction during cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The fundamental element of CICR in the heart is the calcium (Ca(2+)) spark, which arises from a cluster of ryanodine receptors (RyR). Opening of these RyR clusters is triggered to produce a local, regenerative release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The Ca(2+) leak out of the SR is an important process for cellular Ca(2+) management, and it is critically influenced by spark fidelity, i.e., the probability that a spontaneous RyR opening triggers a Ca(2+) spark. Here, we present a detailed, three-dimensional model of a cardiac Ca(2+) release unit that incorporates diffusion, intracellular buffering systems, and stochastically gated ion channels. The model exhibits realistic Ca(2+) sparks and robust Ca(2+) spark termination across a wide range of geometries and conditions. Furthermore, the model captures the details of Ca(2+) spark and nonspark-based SR Ca(2+) leak, and it produces normal excitation-contraction coupling gain. We show that SR luminal Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of the RyR is not critical for spark termination, but it can explain the exponential rise in the SR Ca(2+) leak-load relationship demonstrated in previous experimental work. Perturbations to subspace dimensions, which have been observed in experimental models of disease, strongly alter Ca(2+) spark dynamics. In addition, we find that the structure of RyR clusters also influences Ca(2+) release properties due to variations in inter-RyR coupling via local subspace Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]ss). These results are illustrated for RyR clusters based on super-resolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Finally, we present a believed-novel approach by which the spark fidelity of a RyR cluster can be predicted from structural information of the cluster using the maximum eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. These results provide critical insights into CICR dynamics in heart, under normal and pathological conditions.},

	Abstract = {Neuron-astrocyte communication is an important regulatory mechanism in various brain functions but its complexity and role are yet to be fully understood. In particular, the temporal pattern of astrocyte response to neuronal firing has not been fully characterized. Here, we used neuron-astrocyte cultures on multi-electrode arrays coupled to Ca2+ imaging and explored the range of neuronal stimulation frequencies while keeping constant the amount of stimulation. Our results reveal that astrocytes specifically respond to the frequency of neuronal stimulation by intracellular Ca2+ transients, with a clear onset of astrocytic activation at neuron firing rates around 3-5 Hz. The cell-to-cell heterogeneity of the astrocyte Ca2+ response was however large and increasing with stimulation frequency. Astrocytic activation by neurons was abolished with antagonists of type I metabotropic glutamate receptor, validating the glutamate-dependence of this neuron-to-astrocyte pathway. Using a realistic biophysical model of glutamate-based intracellular calcium signaling in astrocytes, we suggest that the stepwise response is due to the supralinear dynamics of intracellular IP3 and that the heterogeneity of the responses may be due to the heterogeneity of the astrocyte-to-astrocyte couplings via gap junction channels. Therefore our results present astrocyte intracellular Ca2+ activity as a nonlinear integrator of glutamate-dependent neuronal activity.},

	Abstract = {Airway hyperresponsiveness is a major characteristic of asthma and is believed to result from the excessive contraction of airway smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the identification of the mechanisms responsible for airway hyperresponsiveness is hindered by our limited understanding of how calcium (Ca2+), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) interact to regulate airway SMC contraction. In this work, we present a modified Hai-Murphy cross-bridge model of SMC contraction that incorporates Ca2+ regulation of MLCK and MLCP. A comparative fit of the model simulations to experimental data predicts 1), that airway and arteriole SMC contraction is initiated by fast activation by Ca2+ of MLCK; 2), that airway SMC, but not arteriole SMC, is inhibited by a slower activation by Ca2+ of MLCP; and 3), that the presence of a contractile agonist inhibits MLCP to enhance the Ca2+ sensitivity of airway and arteriole SMCs. The implication of these findings is that murine airway SMCs exploit a Ca2+-dependent mechanism to favor a default state of relaxation. The rate of SMC relaxation is determined principally by the rate of release of the latch-bridge state, which is predicted to be faster in airway than in arteriole. In addition, the model also predicts that oscillations in calcium concentration, commonly observed during agonist-induced smooth muscle contraction, cause a significantly greater contraction than an elevated steady calcium concentration.},

	Abstract = {Airway hyperresponsiveness is a major characteristic of asthma and is generally ascribed to excessive airway narrowing associated with the contraction of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). ASMC contraction is initiated by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), observed as oscillatory Ca(2+) waves that can be induced by either agonist or high extracellular K(+) (KCl). In this work, we present a model of oscillatory Ca(2+) waves based on experimental data that incorporate both the inositol trisphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor. We then combined this Ca(2+) model and our modified actin-myosin cross-bridge model to investigate the role and contribution of oscillatory Ca(2+) waves to contractile force generation in mouse ASMCs. The model predicts that: 1), the difference in behavior of agonist- and KCl-induced Ca(2+) waves results principally from the fact that the sarcoplasmic reticulum is depleted during agonist-induced oscillations, but is overfilled during KCl-induced oscillations; 2), regardless of the order in which agonist and KCl are added into the cell, the resulting [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations will always be the short-period, agonist-induced-like oscillations; and 3), both the inositol trisphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor densities are higher toward one end of the cell. In addition, our results indicate that oscillatory Ca(2+) waves generate less contraction than whole-cell Ca(2+) oscillations induced by the same agonist concentration. This is due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the receptor distributions.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism by which glucose induces insulin secretion in β-cells is fairly well understood. Despite years of research, however, the mechanism of glucagon secretion in α-cells is still not well established. It has been proposed that glucose regulates glucagon secretion by decreasing the conductance of either outward ATP-dependent potassium channels (K(ATP)) or an inward store-operated current (SOC). We have developed a mathematical model based on mouse data to test these hypotheses and found that both mechanisms are possible. Glucose metabolism closes K(ATP) channels, which depolarizes the cell but paradoxically reduces calcium influx by inactivating voltage-dependent calcium and sodium channels and decreases secretion. Glucose metabolism also activates SERCA pumps, which fills the endoplasmic reticulum and hyperpolarizes the cells by reducing the inward current through SOC channels and again suppresses glucagon secretion. We find further that the two mechanisms can combine to account for the nonmonotonic dependence of secretion on glucose observed in some studies, an effect that cannot be obtained with either mechanism alone.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a new equilibrium model of the interactions between receptors, ligands, and G-proteins-the cubic ternary complex (CTC) model. The CTC model is a generalization of the extended ternary complex model of Samamaet al.(1993). It incorporates all the features of that model but differs in that it also allows G-proteins to bind to inactive receptors. The addition of this feature produces a complete equilibrium description of the three-way interactions between ligand, receptor, and G-proteins.We show that the standard equilibrium receptor-occupancy models of pharmacology are equivalent to the hierarchical log-linear models of statistics. Using this equivalence, we derive the completeness of the CTC model from both a graphical and a statistical perspective. In its simplest instance (one receptor, one G-protein, and one ligand) the CTC model consists of eight receptor species that can be graphically visualized as occupying the vertices of a cube. Statistically, the CTC model is a saturated three-factor log-linear model. Viewed statistically or graphically, other equilibrium binary and ternary complex models are subsets of the CTC model.},

	Abstract = {1. Cytosolic free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) and whole-cell L-type Ca2+ channel currents were measured during excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in single voltage-clamped rat cardiac ventricular cells. The measurements were used to compute the total cellular efflux of calcium ions through sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channels (FSR,rel) and the influx of Ca2+ via L-type Ca2+ channels (FICa). 2. FSR,rel was elicited by depolarizing voltage-clamp pulses 200 ms in duration to membrane potentials from -30 to +80 mV. Over this range, peak FSR,rel had a bell-shaped dependence on clamp pulse potential. In all cells, the 'gain' of the system, measured as the ratio, FSR,rel(max)/FICa(max), declined from about 16, at 0 mV, to much lower values as clamp pulse voltage was made progressively more positive. We named this phenomenon of change in gain as a function of membrane potential, 'variable gain'. At clamp pulse potentials in the range -30 to 0 mV, the gain differed from cell to cell, being constant at about 16 in some cells, but decreasing from high values (approximately 65) at -20 mV in others. 3. At clamp pulse potentials at which Ca2+ influx (FICa) was maintained, FSR,rel also had a small maintained component. When macroscopic Ca2+ influx was brief (1-2 ms, during 'tails' of FICa), FSR,rel rose rapidly to a peak after repolarization and then declined with a half-time of about 9 ms (typically). 4. The rising phase of [Ca2+]i transients could be interrupted by stopping Ca2+ influx rapidly (by voltage clamp). We therefore termed this phenomenon 'interrupted SR Ca2+ release'.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {We present a probability density approach to modeling localized Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mediated by clusters of ryanodine receptors during excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes. Coupled advection-reaction equations are derived relating the time-dependent probability density of subsarcolemmal subspace and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum [Ca2+] conditioned on "Ca2+ release unit" state. When these equations are solved numerically using a high-resolution finite difference scheme and the resulting probability densities are coupled to ordinary differential equations for the bulk myoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum [Ca2+], a realistic but minimal model of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is produced. Modeling Ca2+ release unit activity using this probability density approach avoids the computationally demanding task of resolving spatial aspects of global Ca2+ signaling, while accurately representing heterogeneous local Ca2+ signals in a population of diadic subspaces and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum depletion domains. The probability density approach is validated for a physiologically realistic number of Ca2+ release units and benchmarked for computational efficiency by comparison to traditional Monte Carlo simulations. In simulated voltage-clamp protocols, both the probability density and Monte Carlo approaches to modeling local control of excitation-contraction coupling produce high-gain Ca2+ release that is graded with changes in membrane potential, a phenomenon not exhibited by so-called "common pool" models. However, a probability density calculation can be significantly faster than the corresponding Monte Carlo simulation, especially when cellular parameters are such that diadic subspace [Ca2+] is in quasistatic equilibrium with junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum [Ca2+] and, consequently, univariate rather than multivariate probability densities may be employed.},

	Abstract = {Considerable insight into intracellular Ca2+ responses has been obtained through the development of whole cell models that are based on molecular mechanisms, e.g., single channel kinetics of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor Ca2+ channel. However, a limitation of most whole cell models to date is the assumption that IP3 receptor Ca2+ channels (IP3Rs) are globally coupled by a "continuously stirred" bulk cytosolic [Ca2+], when in fact open IP3Rs experience elevated "domain" Ca2+ concentrations. Here we present a 2N+2-compartment whole cell model of local and global Ca2+ responses mediated by N=100,000 diffusely distributed IP3Rs, each represented by a four-state Markov chain. Two of these compartments correspond to bulk cytosolic and luminal Ca2+ concentrations, and the remaining 2N compartments represent time-dependent cytosolic and luminal Ca2+ domains associated with each IP3R. Using this Monte Carlo model as a starting point, we present an alternative formulation that solves a system of advection-reaction equations for the probability density of cytosolic and luminal domain [Ca2+] jointly distributed with IP3R state. When these equations are coupled to ordinary differential equations for the bulk cytosolic and luminal [Ca2+], a realistic but minimal model of whole cell Ca2+ dynamics is produced that accounts for the influence of local Ca2+ signaling on channel gating and global Ca2+ responses. The probability density approach is benchmarked and validated by comparison to Monte Carlo simulations, and the two methods are shown to agree when the number of Ca2+ channels is large (i.e., physiologically realistic). Using the probability density approach, we show that the time scale of Ca2+ domain formation and collapse (both cytosolic and luminal) may influence global Ca2+ oscillations, and we derive two reduced models of global Ca2+ dynamics that account for the influence of local Ca2+ signaling on global Ca2+ dynamics when there is a separation of time scales between the stochastic gating of IP3Rs and the dynamics of domain Ca2+.},

We describe a technique, stochastic channel Ca2+ nanoscale resolution (SCCaNR), employing Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes to localize stochastic openings and closings of single Ca2+-permeable channels within <50 nm, and apply it to examine the clustered arrangement of inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) channels underlying local Ca2+ puffs. Fluorescence signals (blips) arising from single functional IP3Rs are almost immotile (diffusion coefficient<0.003 microm2 s(-1)), as are puff sites over prolonged periods, suggesting that the architecture of this signaling system is stable and not subject to rapid, dynamic rearrangement. However, rapid stepwise changes in centroid position of fluorescence are evident within the durations of individual puffs. These apparent movements likely result from asynchronous gating of IP3Rs distributed within clusters that have an overall diameter of approximately 400 nm, indicating that the nanoscale architecture of IP3R clusters is important in shaping local Ca2+ signals. We anticipate that SCCaNR will complement superresolution techniques such as PALM and STORM for studies of Ca2+ channels as it obviates the need for photoswitchable labels and provides functional as well as spatial information.},

The Hill coefficients for the calcium and sodium dependences were 1.0 +/- 0.1 and 2.0 +/- 0.2, respectively. The cooperativity of the sodium dependence allows the terreactant model to be reduced to a bireactant model in which the sodium concentration only appears mathematically as the square of the sodium concentration. The data then fit the relationship (Formula: see text) The experimentally determined value of Vmax is found to be 2.6 +/- 0.5 nmol/mg/min, and the load of calcium (KCa) and concentration of sodium (KNa) necessary to stimulate the efflux to half its maximal calcium-dependent activity and sodium-dependent activity, respectively, were 8.1 +/- 1.4 nmol of Ca2+/mg and 9.4 +/- 0.6 mM Na+.

Mechanisms of altered excitation-contraction coupling in canine tachycardia-induced heart, I: experimental studies. Circ Res. 1999;84:562-570), O'Rourke et al show that Ca2+ transients recorded in myocytes isolated from canine hearts subjected to the tachycardia pacing protocol exhibit similar responses. Analyses of protein levels in these failing hearts reveal that both SR Ca2+ ATPase and phospholamban are decreased on average by 28% and that Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) protein is increased on average by 104%. In this article, we present a model of the canine midmyocardial ventricular action potential and Ca2+ transient. The model is used to estimate the degree of functional upregulation and downregulation of NCX and SR Ca2+ ATPase in heart failure using data obtained from 2 different experimental protocols. Model estimates of average SR Ca2+ ATPase functional downregulation obtained using these experimental protocols are 49% and 62%. Model estimates of average NCX functional upregulation range are 38% and 75%. Simulation of voltage-clamp Ca2+ transients indicates that such changes are sufficient to account for the reduced amplitude, altered shape, and slowed relaxation of Ca2+ transients in the failing canine heart. Model analyses also suggest that altered expression of Ca2+ handling proteins plays a significant role in prolongation of action potential duration in failing canine myocytes.},

The intracellular Ca2+ store is comprised of two calcium pools: A-store which is sensitive to inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) and C-store, insensitive to IP3 but sensitive to Cai. The A-store is refilled by Ca2+ from C-store and reuptake of Cai. The uptake rate is dependent on the degree of filling in the A-store. The C-store, activated by Cai, is replenished by extracellular Ca2+ (Cao). IP3 generated by NA or Ag changes the A-store permeability, discharging its Ca2+ into the cytosol. Depolarization activates Ca2+ current through the L-type channels. The following events are simulated and compared with experimental observations: (a) Cai transient stimulated by high K+; (b) Cai transient and Ca2+ efflux induced by shortlasting and longlasting NA in the absence of Cao; (c) effect of lanthanum on NA-induced Cai and Ca2+ efflux; and (d) effects of nifedipine, ryanodine, BAY K 8644 and cyclopiazonic acid on Cai.},

The receptors for these agonists induce the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a minor plasmalemma lipid, to produce inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol trisphosphate has been shown to mobilize intracellular calcium in hepatocytes. We show here, by means of aequorin measurements in single, isolated rat hepatocytes, that the free Ca response to these agonists consists of a series of transients. Each transient rose within 3 s to a peak free Ca of at least 600 nM and had a duration of approximately 7 s. The transients were repeated at intervals of 0.3-4 min, depending on agonist concentration. Between transients, free Ca returned to the resting level of approximately 200 nM. Clearly, the mechanisms controlling free Ca in hepatocytes are more complex than hitherto suspected.},

Hepatocytes responded to physiological concentrations of the glycogenolytic agonists with a series of repetitive Ca transients. In each transient free Ca rose in 2-3s to above 600 nM from a resting level of 200 nM. Transient duration depended on the agonist and ranged from approximately 7s for phenylephrine to approximately 15s for angiotensin. Transient frequency, but not shape or size, depended on agonist concentration. The period ranged from less than 20s to several minutes.

Both depolarization-dependent Ca2+ entry and intracellular Ca2+ store release contribute to the sugar-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. Here we show that maneuvers depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores induce membrane depolarization and a sustained nitrendipine-sensitive Ca2+ influx, whereas interventions promoting Ca2+ store refilling produce a hyperpolarization and inhibit Ca2+ influx. Both intracellular Ca2+ store depletion and maitotoxin activated a depolarizing nonselective cation current carried principally by Na+ in the physiological range of membrane potentials. The activation of such a current may form the paradigm by which excitable cells refill depleted intracellular Ca2+ stores by depolarization-driven opening of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels.},

	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) functions as a second messenger by liberating intracellular Ca2+ and by promoting influx of extracellular Ca2+. We examined the effects of Ca2+ influx on the temporal and spatial patterns of intracellular Ca2+ liberation in Xenopus oocytes by fluorescence imaging of cytosolic free Ca2+ together with voltage clamp recording of Ca(2+)-activated Cl- currents. Oocytes were injected with a poorly metabolized InsP3 analogue (3-F-InsP3; see Introduction) to induce sustained activation of InsP3 signalling, and Ca2+ influx was controlled by applying voltage steps to change the driving force for Ca2+ entry. Positive- and negative-going potential steps (corresponding, respectively, to decreases and increases in Ca2+ influx) evoked damped oscillatory Cl- currents, accompanied by cyclical changes in cytosolic free Ca2+. The source of this Ca2+ was intracellular, since oscillations persisted when Ca2+ entry was suppressed by removing extracellular Ca2+ or by polarization close to the Ca2+ equilibrium potential. Fluorescence recordings from localized (ca 5 microns) spots on the oocyte showed repetitive Ca2+ spikes. Their frequency increased at more negative potentials, but they became smaller and superimposed on a sustained 'pedestal' of Ca2+. Spike periods ranged from about 50 s at +20 mV to 4s at potentials between -60 and -120 mV. Ca2+ spike frequency decreased after removing extracellular Ca2+, but the spike amplitude was not reduced and low frequency spikes continued for at least 30 min in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Membrane current oscillations decayed in amplitude following voltage steps, while locally recorded Ca2+ spikes did not. This probably arose because Ca2+ release was initially synchronous across the cell, leading to large Ca(2+)-activated Cl- currents, but the currents then diminished as different areas of the cell began to release Ca2+ asynchronously. Fluorescence imaging revealed that Ca2+ liberation in 3-F-InsP3-loaded oocytes occurred as transient localized puffs and as propagating waves. Polarization to more negative potentials increased the frequency of puffs and the number of sites at which they were seen, and enhanced their ability to initiate waves. The frequency and velocity of Ca2+ waves increased at more negative potentials. When the potential was returned to more positive levels, repetitive Ca2+ spikes at first occurred synchronously across the recording area, but this synchronization was gradually lost and Ca2+ waves began at several foci. We conclude that influx of extracellular Ca2+ regulates the temporal and spatial patterns of Ca2+ liberation from InsP3-sensitive intracellular stores, probably as a result of dual excitatory and inhibitory actions of cytosolic Ca2+ on the InsP3 receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins (1,4,5)P3) production during periods of G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated Ca2+ oscillations have been investigated using the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase C (PLC) delta1 tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP-PHPLCdelta1). Activation of noradrenergic alpha1B and muscarinic M3 receptors recombinantly expressed in the same Chinese hamster ovary cell indicates that Ca2+ responses to these G-protein-coupled receptors are stimulus strength-dependent. Thus, activation of alpha1B receptors produced transient base-line Ca2+ oscillations, sinusoidal Ca2+ oscillations, and then a steady-state plateau level of Ca2+ as the level of agonist stimulation increased. Activation of M3 receptors, which have a higher coupling efficiency than alpha1B receptors, produced a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ even at low levels of agonist stimulation. Confocal imaging of eGFP-PHPLCdelta1 visualized periodic increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production underlying the base-line Ca2+ oscillations. Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations were blocked by thapsigargin but not by protein kinase C down-regulation. The net effect of increasing intracellular Ca2+ was stimulatory to Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, and dual imaging experiments indicated that receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 production was sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca2+ between basal and approximately 200 nM. Together, these data suggest that alpha1B receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations result from a positive feedback effect of Ca2+ onto phospholipase C. The mechanisms underlying alpha1B receptor-mediated Ca2+ responses are therefore different from those for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5a, where Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations are the primary driving force for oscillatory Ca2+ responses (Nash, M. S., Young, K. W., Challiss, R. A. J., and Nahorski, S. R. (2001) Nature 413, 381-382). For alpha1B receptors the Ca2+-dependent Ins(1,4,5)P3 production may serve to augment the existing regenerative Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release process; however, the sensitivity to Ca2+ feedback is such that only transient base-line Ca2+ spikes may be capable of causing Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations.},

	Abstract = {The Ca2+ transport adenosine triphosphatase of sarcoplasmic reticulum was reconstituted in unilamellar liposomes prepared by reverse-phase evaporation. The size of the resulting proteoliposomes was similar to that of native sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, but their protein content was much lower, with a protein/lipid ratio (wt/wt) of 1:40-160, as compared with 1:1 in the native membrane. The proteoliposomes sustained adenosine triphosphate-dependent Ca2+ uptake at rates proportional to the protein content (1-2 mumol Ca2+/mg protein/min), reaching asymptotic levels corresponding to a lumenal calcium concentration of 10-20 mM. The low permeability of the proteoliposomes permitted direct demonstration of Ca2+/H+ countertransport and electrogenicity by parallel measurements in the same experimental system. Countertransport of one H+ per one Ca2+ was demonstrated, and inhibition of the Ca2+ pump by lumenal alkalinization was relieved by the H+ ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone. Consistent with the countertransport stoichiometry, net positive charge displacement was produced by Ca2+ transport, as revealed by a rapid oxonol VI absorption rise. The initial rise and the following steady-state level of oxonol absorption were highest when SO4(2-) was the prevalent anion and lowest in the presence of the lipophilic anion SCN-. The influence of anions was attributed to potential driven counterion compensation. The absorption rise was rapidly collapsed by addition of valinomycin in the presence of K+. Experimentation with Ca2+ and H+ ionophores was consistent with a primary role of Ca2+ and H+ in net charge displacement. The estimated value of the steady-state electrical potential observed under optimal conditions was approximately 50 mV and was accounted for by the estimated charge transfer associated with Ca2+ and H+ countertransport under the same conditions.},

	Abstract = {Digital-imaging microfluorimetry, together with microinjection of marker/messenger molecules, was utilized to investigate intercellular Ca2+ signaling in rat pancreatic acinar cells. Stimulation of acini with low concentrations of secretagogues [ 300 pM CCK, > 1 microM CCh), which induce a large "peak-and-plateau" intracellular Ca2+ signal, all cells in the acinus appeared to increase Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) in synchrony. Microinjection of lissarhodamine, a marker of gap-junctional permeability, into cells previously loaded with fura 2 allowed the simultaneous measurement of gap-junctional coupling and [Ca2+]. Stimulation with supermaximal concentrations of agonists resulted in the attenuation of junctional permeability, whereas, during stimulation with physiological concentrations of agonist, junctional communication remained operable. Injection of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] into one cell of an acinar cluster resulted in the generation of a Ca2+ signal in the injected cell and adjacent cells. In contrast, injection of CaCl2 itself did not result in propagation of the signal. When CaCl2 was injected into cells that had been previously stimulated with a threshold concentration of CCK, propagation of a signal was observed between cells. On the basis of these data, a model is proposed in which Ca2+ acts as coagonist with Ins(1,4,5)P3 to potentiate the Ca(2+)-releasing action of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and, by diffusion of the two molecules through gap junctions, underlies intercellular signaling in acinar cells. Gap-junctional communication may be an important factor in amplifying a threshold signal produced in one cell throughout the acinus, resulting in enhanced stimulated secretion in acinar preparations compared with preparations of isolated cells.},

	Abstract = {Activation of InsP(3)Rs (InsP(3) receptors) represents the major mechanism underlying intracellular calcium release in non-excitable cells such as hepatocytes and exocrine cells from the pancreas and salivary glands. Modulation of calcium release through InsP(3)Rs is therefore a major route whereby the temporal and spatial characteristics of calcium waves and oscillations can potentially be 'shaped'. In this study, the functional consequences of phosphoregulation of InsP(3)Rs were investigated. Pancreatic and parotid acinar cells express all three types of InsP(3)R in differing abundance, and all are potential substrates for phosphoregulation. PKA (protein kinase A)-mediated phosphorylation of InsP(3)Rs in pancreatic acinar cells resulted in slowed kinetics of calcium release following photo-release of InsP(3). In contrast, activation of PKA in parotid cells resulted in a marked potentiation of calcium release. In pancreatic acinar cells the predominant InsP(3)R isoform phosphorylated was the type 3 receptor, while the type 2 receptor was markedly phosphorylated in parotid acinar cells. In order to further decipher the effects of phosphorylation on individual InsP(3)R subtypes, DT-40 cell lines expressing homotetramers of a single isoform of InsP(3)R were utilized. These data demonstrate that phosphoregulation of InsP(3)Rs results in subtype-specific effects and may play a role in the specificity of calcium signals by 'shaping' the spatio-temporal profile of the response.},

The single channel kinetics, observed with Cs+ as the charge carrier at different activating (cis) Ca2+ concentrations in the absence of ATP and Mg2+, were similar to earlier reports and were extended by analysis of channel modal behavior. The channel displayed three episodic levels of open probability defining three gating modes: H (high activity), L (low activity), and I (no activity). The large difference in open probabilities between the two active modes resulted from different bursting patterns and different proportions of two distinct channel open states. I-mode was without openings and can be regarded as the inactivated mode of the channel; L-mode was composed of short and sparse openings; and H-mode openings were longer and grouped into bursts. Modal gating may explain calcium-release channel adaptation (as transient prevalence of H-mode after Ca2+ binding) and the inhibitory effects of drugs (as stabilization of mode I), and it provides a basis for understanding the regulation of calcium release.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular Ca(2+) release is a versatile second messenger system. It is modeled here by reaction-diffusion equations for the free Ca(2+) and Ca(2+) buffers, with spatially discrete clusters of stochastic IP(3) receptor channels (IP(3)Rs) controlling the release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum. IP(3)Rs are activated by a small rise of the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and inhibited by large concentrations. Buffering of cytosolic Ca(2+) shapes global Ca(2+) transients. Here we use a model to investigate the effect of buffers with slow and fast reaction rates on single release spikes. We find that, depending on their diffusion coefficient, fast buffers can either decouple clusters or delay inhibition. Slow buffers have little effect on Ca(2+) release, but affect the time course of the signals from the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator mainly by competing for Ca(2+). At low [IP(3)], fast buffers suppress fluorescence signals, slow buffers increase the contrast between bulk signals and signals at open clusters, and large concentrations of buffers, either fast or slow, decouple clusters.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model is presented of autophosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) and its dephosphorylation by a phosphatase. If the total concentration of CaMKII subunits is significantly higher than the phosphatase Michaelis constant, two stable steady states of the CaMKII autophosphorylation can exist in a Ca(2+) concentration range from below the resting value of the intracellular [Ca(2+)] to the threshold concentration for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Bistability is a robust phenomenon, it occurs over a wide range of parameters of the model. Ca(2+) transients that switch CaMKII from the low-phosphorylated state to the high-phosphorylated one are in the same range of amplitudes and frequencies as the Ca(2+) transients that induce LTP. These results show that the CaMKII-phosphatase bistability may play an important role in long-term synaptic modifications. They also suggest a plausible explanation for the very high concentrations of CaMKII found in postsynaptic densities of cerebral neurons.},

	Abstract = {The effect of epinephrine (10(-7) M) on cytosolic free-Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and its dependency on external Ca2+ were studied in fura-2-loaded hepatocytes isolated from three teleost fish species: American eel, brown bullhead, and rainbow trout. Basal [Ca2+]i was similar in eel and trout hepatocytes (79.6 +/- 14.6 and 75.7 +/- 17.4 nM, respectively) but was significantly higher in bullhead cells (184 +/- 23 nM). Epinephrine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were observed only in eel hepatocytes. These oscillations, which presented variable patterns among individual cells, also developed in the absence of external Ca2+, although their amplitude progressively declined to eventually vanish under such conditions. In bullhead hepatocytes, epinephrine induced a biphasic [Ca2+]i response, with an initial transient rise followed by a sustained component; this response was virtually abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The peak [Ca2+]i achieved (433.5 +/- 135.6 nM) was more than two times that of eel cells (184.3 +/- 30 nM) but represented a similar percent increase above control [Ca2+]i for both species. Rainbow trout hepatocytes, contrary to eel and bullhead cells, demonstrated little epinephrine sensitivity, with less than 20% of the cells responding. These data clearly point to significant species differences both in terms of epinephrine-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and in the dependence of these transients on external Ca2+. Thus the eel response relies primarily on intracellular stores, whereas the bullhead response principally involves enhanced influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu. Furthermore, the similarity of these responses with those reported for mammalian hepatocytes strongly suggests that an alpha-adrenoceptor/Ca2+ transduction system is involved in at least eel and bullhead hepatocytes.},

	Abstract = {[Ca(2+)](i) and electrical activity were compared in isolated beta-cells and islets using standard techniques. In islets, raising glucose caused a decrease in [Ca(2+)](i) followed by a plateau and then fast (2-3 min(-1)), slow (0.2-0.8 min(-1)), or a mixture of fast and slow [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. In beta-cells, glucose transiently decreased and then increased [Ca(2+)](i), but no islet-like oscillations occurred. Simultaneous recordings of [Ca(2+)](i) and electrical activity suggested that differences in [Ca(2+)](i) signaling are due to differences in islet versus beta-cell electrical activity. Whereas islets exhibited bursts of spikes on medium/slow plateaus, isolated beta-cells were depolarized and exhibited spiking, fast-bursting, or spikeless plateaus. These electrical patterns in turn produced distinct [Ca(2+)](i) patterns. Thus, although isolated beta-cells display several key features of islets, their oscillations were faster and more irregular. beta-cells could display islet-like [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations if their electrical activity was converted to a slower islet-like pattern using dynamic clamp. Islet and beta-cell [Ca(2+)](i) changes followed membrane potential, suggesting that electrical activity is mainly responsible for the [Ca(2+)] dynamics of beta-cells and islets. A recent model consisting of two slow feedback processes and passive endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release was able to account for islet [Ca(2+)](i) responses to glucose, islet oscillations, and conversion of single cell to islet-like [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. With minimal parameter variation, the model could also account for the diverse behaviors of isolated beta-cells, suggesting that these behaviors reflect natural cell heterogeneity. These results support our recent model and point to the important role of beta-cell electrical events in controlling [Ca(2+)](i) over diverse time scales in islets.},

	Abstract = {A major obstacle in the analysis of many physiological models is the issue of model simplification. Various methods have been used for simplifying such models, with one common technique being to eliminate certain 'fast' variables using a quasi-steady-state assumption. In this article, we show when such a physiological model reduction technique in a slow-fast system is mathematically justified. We provide counterexamples showing that this technique can give erroneous results near the onset of oscillatory behaviour which is, practically, the region of most importance in a model. In addition, we show that the singular limit of the first Lyapunov coefficient of a Hopf bifurcation in a slow-fast system is, in general, not equal to the first Lyapunov coefficient of the Hopf bifurcation in the corresponding layer problem, a seemingly counterintuitive result. Consequently, one cannot deduce, in general, the criticality of a Hopf bifurcation in a slow-fast system from the lower-dimensional layer problem.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ sparks are short lived and localized Ca2+ transients resulting from the opening of ryanodine receptors in sarcoplasmic reticulum. These events relax certain types of smooth muscle by activating big conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels to produce spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) and the resultant closure of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. But in many smooth muscles from a variety of organs, Ca2+ sparks can additionally activate Ca2+-activated Cl(-) channels to generate spontaneous transient inward current (STICs). To date, the physiological roles of Ca2+ sparks in this latter group of smooth muscle remain elusive. Here, we show that in airway smooth muscle, Ca2+ sparks under physiological conditions, activating STOCs and STICs, induce biphasic membrane potential transients (BiMPTs), leading to membrane potential oscillations. Paradoxically, BiMPTs stabilize the membrane potential by clamping it within a negative range and prevent the generation of action potentials. Moreover, blocking either Ca2+ sparks or hyperpolarization components of BiMPTs activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, resulting in an increase in global [Ca2+](i) and cell contraction. Therefore, Ca2+ sparks in smooth muscle presenting both STICs and STOCs act as a stabilizer of membrane potential, and altering the balance can profoundly alter the status of excitability and contractility. These results reveal a novel mechanism underlying the control of excitability and contractility in smooth muscle.},

	Abstract = {Synaptic transmission is a dynamic process. Postsynaptic responses wax and wane as presynaptic activity evolves. This prominent characteristic of chemical synaptic transmission is a crucial determinant of the response properties of synapses and, in turn, of the stimulus properties selected by neural networks and of the patterns of activity generated by those networks. This review focuses on synaptic changes that result from prior activity in the synapse under study, and is restricted to short-term effects that last for at most a few minutes. Forms of synaptic enhancement, such as facilitation, augmentation, and post-tetanic potentiation, are usually attributed to effects of a residual elevation in presynaptic [Ca(2+)]i, acting on one or more molecular targets that appear to be distinct from the secretory trigger responsible for fast exocytosis and phasic release of transmitter to single action potentials. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis, and the origins of the different kinetic phases of synaptic enhancement, as well as the interpretation of statistical changes in transmitter release and roles played by other factors such as alterations in presynaptic Ca(2+) influx or postsynaptic levels of [Ca(2+)]i. Synaptic depression dominates enhancement at many synapses. Depression is usually attributed to depletion of some pool of readily releasable vesicles, and various forms of the depletion model are discussed. Depression can also arise from feedback activation of presynaptic receptors and from postsynaptic processes such as receptor desensitization. In addition, glial-neuronal interactions can contribute to short-term synaptic plasticity. Finally, we summarize the recent literature on putative molecular players in synaptic plasticity and the effects of genetic manipulations and other modulatory influences.},

Such sites between lysosomes and the ER potentially provide a platform for signaling by the Ca(2+) mobilizing messenger NAADP. However, at present we know little of how Ca(2+) release events are coordinated at these experimentally intractable junctions. We therefore developed a computational model of lysosome-ER microdomains, which suggested that small leaks of Ca(2+) from the lysosome couple to Ca(2+)-sensitive Ins(1,4,5)P 3 receptors on the ER to generate global, microdomain-dependent Ca(2+) signals. Here we discuss how the "mix-and-match" arrangement of different Ca(2+) signaling proteins on the "source" and "target" membranes might generate functionally heterogeneous Ca(2+) microdomains.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the key characteristics of Ca(2+) puffs in deterministic and stochastic frameworks that all incorporate the cellular morphology of IP(3) receptor channel clusters. In the first step, we numerically study the Ca(2+) liberation in a three-dimensional representation of a cluster environment with reaction-diffusion dynamics in both the cytosol and the lumen. These simulations reveal that Ca(2+) concentrations at a releasing cluster range from 80 to 170 microM and equilibrate almost instantaneously on the time scale of the release duration. These highly elevated Ca(2+) concentrations eliminate Ca(2+) oscillations in a deterministic model of an IP(3)R channel cluster at physiological parameter values as revealed by a linear stability analysis. The reason lies in the saturation of all feedback processes in the IP(3)R gating dynamics, so that only fluctuations can restore experimentally observed Ca(2+) oscillations. In this spirit, we derive master equations that allow us to analytically quantify the onset of Ca(2+) puffs and hence the stochastic time scale of intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics. Moving up the spatial scale, we suggest to formulate cellular dynamics in terms of waiting time distribution functions. This approach prevents the state space explosion that is typical for the description of cellular dynamics based on channel states and still contains information on molecular fluctuations. We illustrate this method by studying global Ca(2+) oscillations.},

Here, we demonstrate MCU oligomerization by immunoprecipitation and F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and characterize a novel protein (MCUb) with two predicted transmembrane domains, 50% sequence similarity and a different expression profile from MCU. Based on computational modelling, MCUb includes critical amino-acid substitutions in the pore region and indeed MCUb does not form a calcium-permeable channel in planar lipid bilayers. In HeLa cells, MCUb is inserted into the oligomer and exerts a dominant-negative effect, reducing the [Ca(2+)]mt increases evoked by agonist stimulation. Accordingly, in vitro co-expression of MCUb with MCU drastically reduces the probability of observing channel activity in planar lipid bilayer experiments. These data unveil the structural complexity of MCU and demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism, based on the inclusion of dominant-negative subunits in a multimeric channel, that underlies the fine control of the physiologically and pathologically relevant process of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis.},

Here we model clusters of heterogeneous cells that differ in size, channel density, and other parameters. We use gap-junctional electrical coupling, with conductances determined by an experimental histogram. We find that, for reasonable parameter distributions, only a small proportion of isolated beta cells will burst when uncoupled, at any given value of a glucose-sensing parameter. However, a coupled, heterogeneous cluster of such cells, if sufficiently large (approximately 125 cells), will burst synchronously. Small clusters of such cells will burst only with low probability. In large clusters, the dynamics of intracellular calcium compare well with experiments. Also, these clusters possess a dose-response curve of increasing average electrical activity with respect to a glucose-sensing parameter that is sharp when the cluster is coupled, but shallow when the cluster is decoupled into individual cells. This is in agreement with comparative experiments on cells in suspension and islets.},

	Abstract = {To clarify the role of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange (NCX(mito)) in regulating mitochondrial Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(mito)) concentration at intact and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(mito)), we measured Ca(2+)(mito) and DeltaPsi(mito) using fluorescence probes Rhod-2 and TMRE, respectively, in the permeabilized rat ventricular cells. Applying 300 nm cytoplasmic Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(c)) increased Ca(2+)(mito) and this increase was attenuated by cytoplasmic Na(+) (Na(+)(c)) with an IC(50) of 2.4 mm. To the contrary, when DeltaPsi(mito) was depolarized by FCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, Na(+)(c) enhanced the Ca(2+)(c)-induced increase in Ca(2+)(mito) with an EC(50) of about 4 mm. This increase was not significantly affected by ruthenium red or cyclosporin A. The inhibition of NCX(mito) by CGP-37157 further increased Ca(2+)(mito) when DeltaPsi(mito) was intact, while it suppressed the Ca(2+)(mito) increase when DeltaPsi(mito) was depolarized, suggesting that DeltaPsi(mito) depolarization changed the exchange mode from forward to reverse. Furthermore, DeltaPsi(mito) depolarization significantly reduced the Ca(2+)(mito) decrease via forward mode, and augmented the Ca(2+)(mito) increase via reverse mode. When the respiratory chain was attenuated, the induction of the reverse mode of NCX(mito) hyperpolarized DeltaPsi(mito), while DeltaPsi(mito) depolarized upon inducing the forward mode of NCX(mito). Both changes in DeltaPsi(mito) were remarkably inhibited by CGP-37157. The above experimental data indicated that NCX(mito) is voltage dependent and electrogenic. This notion was supported theoretically by computer simulation studies with an NCX(mito) model constructed based on present and previous studies, presuming a consecutive and electrogenic Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange and a depolarization-induced increase in Na(+) flux. It is concluded that Ca(2+)(mito) concentration is dynamically modulated by Na(+)(c) and DeltaPsi(mito) via electrogenic NCX(mito).},

	Abstract = {The energy production of mitochondria in heart increases during exercise. Several works have suggested that calcium acts at multiple control points to activate net ATP production in what is termed "parallel activation". To study this, a computational model of mitochondrial energy metabolism in the heart has been developed that integrates the Dudycha-Jafri model for the tricarboxylic acid cycle with the Magnus-Keizer model for mitochondrial energy metabolism and calcium dynamics. The model improves upon the previous formulation by including an updated formulation for calcium dynamics, and new descriptions of sodium, hydrogen, phosphate, and ATP balance. To this end, it incorporates new formulations for the calcium uniporter, sodium-calcium exchange, sodium-hydrogen exchange, the F(1)F(0)-ATPase, and potassium-hydrogen exchange. The model simulates a wide range of experimental data, including steady-state and simulated pacing protocols. The model suggests that calcium is a potent activator of net ATP production and that as pacing increases energy production due to calcium goes up almost linearly. Furthermore, it suggests that during an extramitochondrial calcium transient, calcium entry and extrusion cause a transient depolarization that serve to increase NADH production by the tricarboxylic acid cycle and NADH consumption by the respiration driven proton pumps. The model suggests that activation of the F(1)F(0)-ATPase by calcium is essential to increase ATP production. In mitochondria very close to the release sites, the depolarization is more severe causing a temporary loss of ATP production. However, due to the short duration of the depolarization the net ATP production is also increased.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondria are known to possess a rapid calcium uptake mechanism or uniport and both sodium-dependent and sodium-independent efflux mechanisms. Whether sodium-independent calcium efflux is mediated and whether sodium-dependent calcium efflux can be found in liver mitochondria have been questioned. Kinetics results relevant to the answers of these questions are discussed below. A slow, mediated, sodium-independent calcium efflux mechanism is identified which shows second order kinetics. This mechanism, which shows "nonessential activation" kinetics, has a Vmax around 1.2 nmol calcium per mg protein per min and a half maximal velocity around 8.4 nmol calcium per mg protein. A slow, sodium-dependent calcium efflux mechanism is identified, which is first order in calcium and second order in sodium. This mechanism has a Vmax around 2.6 nmol of calcium per mg protein per min. The sodium dependence is half saturated at an external sodium concentration of 9.4 mM, and the calcium dependence is half saturated at an internal calcium concentration of 8.1 nmol calcium per mg protein. The cooperativity of the sodium dependence effectively permits a terreactant system to be fit by a bireactant model in which [Na] only appears as the square of [Na]. This liver system shows simultaneous, as opposed to ping-pong, kinetics. It is also found to be sensitive to inhibition by tetraphenyl phosphonium, magnesium, and ruthenium red. A model is proposed in which mitochondrial calcium transport could function to "shape the pulses" of cytosolic calcium. Simultaneously, mitochondria may mediate a "calcium memory" coupled perhaps to activation of cytosolic events through calmodulin or perhaps to activation of electron transport through the activation of specific dehydrogenases by intramitochondrial calcium.},

	Abstract = {In many cell types, transfer of Ca(2+) released via ryanodine receptors (RyR) to the mitochondrial matrix is locally supported by high [Ca(2+)] microdomains at close contacts between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria. Here we studied whether the close contacts were secured via direct physical coupling in cardiac muscle using isolated rat heart mitochondria (RHMs). "Immuno-organelle chemistry" revealed RyR2 and calsequestrin-positive SR particles associated with mitochondria in both crude and Percoll-purified "heavy" mitochondrial fractions (cRHM and pRHM), to a smaller extent in the latter one. Mitochondria-associated vesicles were also visualized by electron microscopy in the RHMs. Western blot analysis detected greatly reduced presence of SR markers (calsequestrin, SERCA2a, and phospholamban) in pRHM, suggesting that the mitochondria-associated particles represented a small subfraction of the SR. Fluorescence calcium imaging in rhod2-loaded cRHM revealed mitochondrial matrix [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](m)) responses to caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release that were prevented when thapsigargin was added to predeplete the SR or by mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake inhibitors. Importantly, caffeine failed to increase [Ca(2+)] in the large volume of the incubation medium, suggesting that local Ca(2+) transfer between the SR particles and mitochondria mediated the [Ca(2+)](m) signal. Despite the substantially reduced SR presence, pRHM still displayed a caffeine-induced [Ca(2+)](m) rise comparable with the one recorded in cRHM. Thus, a relatively small fraction of the total SR is physically coupled and transfers Ca(2+) locally to the mitochondria in cardiac muscle. The transferred Ca(2+) stimulates dehydrogenase activity and affects mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, indicating the broad significance of the physical coupling in mitochondrial function.},

	Abstract = {Treatment of hepatocytes with agonists which act via the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), results in increases of cytosolic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) which are manifest as a series of discrete [Ca2+]i transients or oscillations. With increasing agonist dose [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency increases and the initial latent period decreases, but the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i oscillations remains constant. Studies of these [Ca2+]i oscillations at the subcellular level have indicated that the [Ca2+]i changes do not occur synchronously throughout the cell, but initiate at a specific subcellular domain, adjacent to a region of the plasma membrane, and then propagate through the cell as a [Ca2+]i wave. For a given ceil, the locus of [Ca2+]i wave initiation is constant for every oscillation in a series and is also identical when the cell is sequentially stimulated with different agonists or when the phospholipase C-linked G protein is activated directly using AIF4-. The kinetics of the [Ca2+]i waves indicate that a Ca(2+)-activated mechanism is involved in propagating the oscillatory [Ca2+]i increases throughout the cell, and the data appear to be most consistent with a process of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. It is proposed that the ability to propagate [Ca2+]i oscillations into regions of the cell distal to the region in which the signal transduction apparatus is localized could serve an important function in allowing all parts of the cell to respond to the stimulus.},

	Abstract = {Calcium signal transmission between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is supported by a local [Ca(2+)] control that operates between IP(3)receptor Ca(2+)release channels (IP(3)R) and mitochondrial Ca(2+)uptake sites, and displays functional similarities to synaptic transmission. Activation of IP(3)R by IP(3)is known to evoke quantal Ca(2+)mobilization that is associated with incremental elevations of mitochondrial matrix [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](m)). Here we report that activation of IP(3)R by adenophostin-A (AP) yields non-quantal Ca(2+)mobilization in mast cells. We also show that the AP-induced continuous Ca(2+)release causes relatively small [Ca(2+)](m)responses, in particular, the sustained phase of Ca(2+)release is not sensed by the mitochondria. Inhibition of ER Ca(2+)pumps by thapsigargin slightly increases IP(3)-induced [Ca(2+)](m)responses, but augments AP-induced [Ca(2+)](m)responses in a large extent. In adherent permeabilized cells exposed to elevated [Ca(2+)], ER Ca(2+)uptake fails to affect global cytosolic [Ca(2+)], but attenuates [Ca(2+)](m)responses. Moreover, almost every mitochondrion exhibits a region very close to ER Ca(2+)pumps visualized by BODIPY-FL-thapsigargin or SERCA antibody. Thus, at the ER-mitochondrial junctions, localized ER Ca(2+)uptake provides a mechanism to attenuate the mitochondrial response during continuous Ca(2+)release through the IP(3)R or during gradual Ca(2+)influx to the junction between ER and mitochondria.},

	Abstract = {Calcium ions are ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules, capable of decoding a variety of extracellular stimuli (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, etc.) into markedly different intracellular actions, ranging from contraction to secretion, from proliferation to cell death. The key to this pleiotropic role is the complex spatiotemporal organization of the [Ca(2+)] rise evoked by extracellular agonists, which allows selected effectors to be recruited and specific actions to be initiated. In this review, we discuss the structural and functional bases that generate the subcellular heterogeneity in cellular Ca(2+) levels at rest and under stimulation. This complex choreography requires the concerted action of many different players; the central role is, of course, that of the calcium ion, with the main supporting characters being all the entities responsible for moving Ca(2+) between different compartments, while the cellular architecture provides a determining framework within which all the players have their exits and their entrances. In particular, we concentrate on the molecular mechanisms that lead to the generation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) microdomains, focusing on their different subcellular location, mechanism of generation, and functional role.},

	Abstract = {Whereas Ca(2+) signalling in ventricular cardiomyocytes is well described, much less is known regarding the Ca(2+) signals within atrial cells. This is surprising given that atrial cardiomyocytes make an important contribution to the refilling of ventricles with blood, which enhances the subsequent ejection of blood from the heart. The dependence of cardiac function on the contribution of atria becomes increasingly important with age and exercise. Disruption of the rhythmic beating of atrial cardiomyocytes can lead to life-threatening conditions such as atrial fibrillation. Atrial and ventricular myocytes have many structural and functional similarities. However, one key structural difference, the lack of transverse tubules ("T-tubules") in atrial myocytes, make these two cell types display vastly different calcium patterns in response to electrical excitation. The lack of T-tubules in atrial myocytes means that depolarisation provokes calcium signals that originate around the periphery of the cells. Under resting conditions, such Ca(2+) signals do not propagate towards the centre of the atrial cells and so do not fully engage the contractile machinery. Consequently, contraction of atrial myocytes under resting conditions is modest. However, when atrial myocytes are stimulated with a positive inotropic agonist, such as isoproterenol, the peripheral Ca(2+) signals trigger a global wave of Ca(2+) that propagates in a centripetal manner into the cells. Enhanced centripetal movement of Ca(2+) in atrial myocytes leads to increased contraction and a more substantial contribution to blood pumping.

	Abstract = {Most models of learning and memory assume that memories are maintained in neuronal circuits by persistent synaptic modifications induced by specific patterns of pre- and postsynaptic activity. For this scenario to be viable, synaptic modifications must survive the ubiquitous ongoing activity present in neural circuits in vivo. In this paper, we investigate the time scales of memory maintenance in a calcium-based synaptic plasticity model that has been shown recently to be able to fit different experimental data-sets from hippocampal and neocortical preparations. We find that in the presence of background activity on the order of 1 Hz parameters that fit pyramidal layer 5 neocortical data lead to a very fast decay of synaptic efficacy, with time scales of minutes. We then identify two ways in which this memory time scale can be extended: (i) the extracellular calcium concentration in the experiments used to fit the model are larger than estimated concentrations in vivo. Lowering extracellular calcium concentration to in vivo levels leads to an increase in memory time scales of several orders of magnitude; (ii) adding a bistability mechanism so that each synapse has two stable states at sufficiently low background activity leads to a further boost in memory time scale, since memory decay is no longer described by an exponential decay from an initial state, but by an escape from a potential well. We argue that both features are expected to be present in synapses in vivo. These results are obtained first in a single synapse connecting two independent Poisson neurons, and then in simulations of a large network of excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons. Our results emphasise the need for studying plasticity at physiological extracellular calcium concentration, and highlight the role of synaptic bi- or multistability in the stability of learned synaptic structures.},

	Abstract = {Synapses display remarkable alterations in strength during repetitive use. Different types of synapses exhibit distinctive synaptic plasticity, but the factors giving rise to such diversity are not fully understood. To provide the experimental basis for a general model of short-term plasticity, we studied three synapses in rat brain slices at 34 degrees C: the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, and the Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. These synapses exhibited a broad range of responses to regular and Poisson stimulus trains. Depression dominated at the climbing fiber synapse, facilitation was prominent at the parallel fiber synapse, and both depression and facilitation were apparent in the Schaffer collateral synapse. These synapses were modeled by incorporating mechanisms of short-term plasticity that are known to be driven by residual presynaptic calcium (Ca(res)). In our model, release is the product of two factors: facilitation and refractory depression. Facilitation is caused by a calcium-dependent increase in the probability of release. Refractory depression is a consequence of release sites becoming transiently ineffective after release. These sites recover with a time course that is accelerated by elevations of Ca(res). Facilitation and refractory depression are coupled by their common dependence on Ca(res) and because increased transmitter release leads to greater synaptic depression. This model captures the behavior of three different synapses for various stimulus conditions. The interplay of facilitation and depression dictates synaptic strength and variability during repetitive activation.

Bursts are generated by positive feedback through excitatory connections and terminated by a slow depression of network excitability. Similar activity has been observed in cultures of spinal neurons containing inhibitory synapses. Is burst generation in these cultures operating according to the mechanism proposed for developing networks? To answer this question without perturbing the activity, we analyzed the burst pattern of individual neurons in active cultures. We observed a correlation between burst size and preceding interburst interval and a rapid rise and progressive decrease in firing rate during a burst. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of burst generation proposed for developing networks.},

	Abstract = {Dopamine (DA) released from the hypothalamus tonically inhibits pituitary lactotrophs. DA (at micromolar concentration) opens potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the lactotrophs and thus preventing the calcium influx that triggers prolactin hormone release. Surprisingly, at concentrations approximately 1000 lower, DA can stimulate prolactin secretion. Here, we investigated whether an increase in a K+ current could mediate this stimulatory effect. We considered the fast K+ currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both IBK and IA could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms. IBK always increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while IA could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K+ conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters. In addition, the study illustrates that},

	Abstract = {Models of bursting in single cells typically include two subsystems with different timescales. Variations in one or more slow variables switch the system between a silent and a spiking state. We have developed a model for bursting in the pituitary lactotroph that does not include any slow variable. The model incorporates fast, noninactivating calcium and potassium currents (the spike-generating mechanism), as well as the fast, inactivating A-type potassium current (I(A)). I(A) is active only briefly at the beginning of a burst, but this brief impulse of I(A) acts as a burst trigger, injecting the spike trajectory close to an unstable steady state. The spiraling of the trajectory away from the steady state produces a period of low-amplitude spiking typical of lactotrophs. Increasing the conductance of A-type potassium current brings the trajectory closer to the unstable steady state, increasing burst duration. However, this also increases interburst interval, and for larger conductance values, all activity stops. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a physiologically based, single-compartmental model of bursting with no slow subsystem.},

In this review, we discuss two rhythms of in vivo prolactin release in female rats and the ongoing research that we and others have performed aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying them. The peptide hormone oxytocin appears to play an important role in both rhythms. One rhythm occurs during the first half of pregnancy, but can also be induced in ovariectomised rats. This is characterised by a circadian pattern with two prolactin surges per day. Two methods for triggering this rhythm are discussed, each utilising a unique physiological pathway that includes oxytocin action, presumably on pituitary lactotrophs. The second rhythm occurs during the oestrous cycle and is characterised by a surge of prolactin on the afternoon of pro-oestrus. We discuss recent findings that oxytocin is more effective at stimulating prolactin release from lactotrophs taken from animals on the afternoon of pro-oestrus than from those of animals on the morning of dioestrus 1, raising the possibility that this hormone plays a physiological role in the regulation of prolactin secretion during the oestrous cycle.},

	Abstract = {Endocrine pituitary cells are neuronlike; they express numerous voltage-gated sodium, calcium, potassium, and chloride channels and fire action potentials spontaneously, accompanied by a rise in intracellular calcium. In some cells, spontaneous electrical activity is sufficient to drive the intracellular calcium concentration above the threshold for stimulus-secretion and stimulus-transcription coupling. In others, the function of these action potentials is to maintain the cells in a responsive state with cytosolic calcium near, but below, the threshold level. Some pituitary cells also express gap junction channels, which could be used for intercellular Ca(2+) signaling in these cells. Endocrine cells also express extracellular ligand-gated ion channels, and their activation by hypothalamic and intrapituitary hormones leads to amplification of the pacemaking activity and facilitation of calcium influx and hormone release. These cells also express numerous G protein-coupled receptors, which can stimulate or silence electrical activity and action potential-dependent calcium influx and hormone release. Other members of this receptor family can activate calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a cell type-specific modulation of electrical activity. This review summarizes recent findings in this field and our current understanding of the complex relationship between voltage-gated ion channels, ligand-gated ion channels, gap junction channels, and G protein-coupled receptors in pituitary cells.},

Moreover, the pancreas is able to recognize the rate of change of the glucose concentration. We present a relatively simple model of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, yet founded on solid physiological grounds and capable of reproducing a series of secretion patterns from perfused pancreases as well as from stimulated islets. The model includes the notion of distinct pools of granules as well as mechanisms such as mobilization, priming, exocytosis and kiss-and-run. Based on experimental data, we suggest that the individual beta-cells activate at different glucose concentrations. The model reproduces most of the data it was tested against very well, and can therefore serve as a general model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Simulations predict that the effect of an increased frequency of kiss-and-run exocytotic events is a reduction in insulin secretion without modification of the qualitative pattern. Our model also appears to be the first physiology-based one to reproduce the staircase experiment, which underlies 'derivative control', i.e. the pancreatic capacity of measuring the rate of change of the glucose concentration.},

Recently, we have proposed a minimal model for the incretin effect by which the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) enhances insulin secretion.

	Abstract = {In this report we describe a mathematical model for the regulation of cAMP dynamics in pancreatic beta-cells. Incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) increase cAMP and augment insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. Imaging experiments performed in MIN6 insulinoma cells expressing a genetically encoded cAMP biosensor and loaded with fura-2, a calcium indicator, showed that cAMP oscillations are differentially regulated by periodic changes in membrane potential and GLP-1. We modeled the interplay of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) and its interaction with calmodulin, G protein-coupled receptor activation, adenylyl cyclases (AC), and phosphodiesterases (PDE). Simulations with the model demonstrate that cAMP oscillations are coupled to cytoplasmic Ca(2+) oscillations in the beta-cell. Slow Ca(2+) oscillations (<1 min(-1)) produce low-frequency cAMP oscillations, and faster Ca(2+) oscillations (>3-4 min(-1)) entrain high-frequency, low-amplitude cAMP oscillations. The model predicts that GLP-1 receptor agonists induce cAMP oscillations in phase with cytoplasmic Ca(2+) oscillations. In contrast, observed antiphasic Ca(2+) and cAMP oscillations can be simulated following combined glucose and tetraethylammonium-induced changes in membrane potential. The model provides additional evidence for a pivotal role for Ca(2+)-dependent AC and PDE activation in coupling of Ca(2+) and cAMP signals. Our results reveal important differences in the effects of glucose/TEA and GLP-1 on cAMP dynamics in MIN6 beta-cells.},

	Abstract = {Chaotic bursting has been recorded in synaptically isolated neurons of the pyloric central pattern generating (CPG) circuit in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. Conductance-based models of pyloric neurons typically fail to reproduce the observed irregular behavior in either voltage time series or state-space trajectories. Recent suggestions of Chay [Biol Cybern 75: 419-431] indicate that chaotic bursting patterns can be generated by model neurons that couple membrane currents to the nonlinear dynamics of intracellular calcium storage and release. Accordingly, we have built a two-compartment model of a pyloric CPG neuron incorporating previously described membrane conductances together with intracellular Ca2+ dynamics involving the endoplasmic reticulum and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor IP3R. As judged by qualitative inspection and quantitative, nonlinear analysis, the irregular voltage oscillations of the model neuron resemble those seen in the biological neurons. Chaotic bursting arises from the interaction of fast membrane voltage dynamics with slower intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and, hence, depends on the concentration of IP3. Despite the presence of 12 independent dynamical variables, the model neuron bursts chaotically in a subspace characterized by 3-4 active degrees of freedom. The critical aspect of this model is that chaotic oscillations arise when membrane voltage processes are coupled to another slow dynamic. Here we suggest this slow dynamic to be intracellular Ca2+ handling.},

	Abstract = {We present a mathematical analysis of the dynamics that underlies plateau bursting in models of endocrine cells under variation of the location of the (unstable) equilibrium around which these bursting patterns are organised. We focus primarily on the less well-studied case of pseudo-plateau bursting, but also consider the square-wave case. The behaviour of such models is explained using the theory for systems with multiple time scales and it is well known that the underlying so-called fast subsystem organises their dynamics. However, such results are valid only in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the singular limit that defines the fast subsystem. Hence, the slow variable (intracellular calcium concentration) must be very slow, which is actually not the case for pseudo-plateau bursting. Furthermore, the theoretical predictions are also only valid for parameter values such that the equilibrium is close to a homoclinic bifurcation occuring in the fast subsystem. In the present study, we use numerical explorations to discuss what happens outside this theoretically known neighbourhood of parameter space. In particular, we consider what happens as the equilibrium moves outside a small neighbourhood of the homoclinic bifurcation that occurs in the fast subsystem, and relatively fast speeds are allowed for the slow variable which is controlled by a relatively large value of a parameter ε. The results obtained complement our earlier work [Tsaneva-Atanasova et al. (2010) J Theor Biol264, 1133-1146], which focussed on how the bursting patterns vary with the rate of change ε of the slow variable: we fix ε and move the equilibrium over the full range of the bursting regime. Our findings show that the transitions between different bursting patterns are rather similar for square-wave and pseudo-plateau bursting, provided that the value of ε for the pseudo-plateau-bursting model is chosen so that it is much larger than for the square-wave bursting model. Furthermore, the two families of tonic spiking and plateau bursting, which are generally viewed as two separately generated families, are actually connected into a single family in the two-parameter plane through branches of unstable periodic orbits.},

	Abstract = {We present a theoretical investigation of the effect of Ca2+ influx through ion channels in the plasma membrane on Ca2+ oscillations induced by agonist stimulation of Ca2+ release from internal stores. We expand a recent model of internal Ca2+ oscillations based on activation and inhibition of the IP3-receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum by introducing plasma membrane voltage-gated Ca2+ and K+ channels based on patch-clamp experiments on mouse pancreatic beta cells. Simulations of voltage- and current-clamped experiments are carried out. The amplitude and frequency of the oscillations as well as the sensitivity to agonist are strongly affected by altering the value of the voltage-clamp. We show that the fundamental quantity governing voltage clamp measurements is the inward flux of Ca2+, which acts as a control parameter to alter characteristics of the oscillations. Under current clamp conditions (I(applied) = 0) that lead to continuous spiking electrical activity, we examine the coupling between electrical activity and Ca2+ by introducing a small whole cell Ca(2+)-activated K+ conductance. Results of calculations are similar to those observed in agonist-stimulated beta cells and gonadotrophs. We conclude, however, that glucose-induced bursting and agonist induced bursting in beta cells are distinct phenomena and suggest a mechanism by which agonist-induced Ca2+ oscillations might potentiate insulin secretion. This leads to a general principle for selective signal transduction by Ca2+ oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Local calcium transients ('Ca2+ sparks') are thought to be elementary Ca2+ signals in heart, skeletal and smooth muscle cells. Ca2+ sparks result from the opening of a single, or the coordinated opening of many, tightly clustered ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In arterial smooth muscle, Ca2+ sparks appear to be involved in opposing the tonic contraction of the blood vessel. Intravascular pressure causes a graded membrane potential depolarization to approximately -40 mV, an elevation of arterial wall [Ca2+]i and contraction ('myogenic tone') of arteries. Ca2+ sparks activate calcium-sensitive K+ (KCa) channels in the sarcolemmal membrane to cause membrane hyperpolarization, which opposes the pressure induced depolarization. Thus, inhibition of Ca2+ sparks by ryanodine, or of KCa channels by iberiotoxin, leads to membrane depolarization, activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and vasoconstriction. Conversely, activation of Ca2+ sparks can lead to vasodilation through activation of KCa channels. Our recent work is aimed at studying the properties and roles of Ca2+ sparks in the regulation of arterial smooth muscle function. The modulation of Ca2+ spark frequency and amplitude by membrane potential, cyclic nucleotides and protein kinase C will be explored. The role of local Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the regulation of Ca2+ spark properties will also be examined. Finally, using functional evidence from cardiac myocytes, and histological evidence from smooth muscle, we shall explore whether Ca2+ channels, RyR channels, and KCa channels function as a coupled unit, through Ca2+ and voltage, to regulate arterial smooth muscle membrane potential and vascular tone.},

	Abstract = {Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors contributes to the relaxation of urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM) through activation of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels. We examined the mechanisms by which beta-adrenoceptor stimulation leads to an elevation of the activity of BK channels in UBSM. Depolarization from -70 to +10 mV evokes an inward L-type dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (VDCC) current, followed by outward steady-state and transient BK current. In the presence of ryanodine, which blocks the transient BK currents, isoproterenol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, increased the VDCC current by approximately 25% and the steady-state BK current by approximately 30%. In the presence of the BK channel inhibitor iberiotoxin, isoproterenol did not cause activation of the remaining steady-state K(+) current component. Decreasing Ca(2+) influx through VDCC by nifedipine or depolarization to +80 mV suppressed the isoproterenol-induced activation of the steady-state BK current. Unlike forskolin, isoproterenol did not change significantly the open probability of single BK channels in the absence of Ca(2+) sparks and with VDCC inhibited by nifedipine. Isoproterenol elevated Ca(2+) spark (local intracellular Ca(2+) release through ryanodine receptors of the sarcoplasmic reticulum) frequency and associated transient BK currents by approximately 1.4-fold. The data support the concept that in UBSM beta-adrenoceptor stimulation activates BK channels by elevating Ca(2+) influx through VDCC and by increasing Ca(2+) sparks, but not through a Ca(2+)-independent mechanism. This study reveals key regulatory molecular and cellular mechanisms of beta-adrenergic regulation of BK channels in UBSM that could provide new targets for drugs in the treatment of bladder dysfunction.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between Ca2+ release ("Ca2+ sparks") through ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and KCa channels was examined in smooth muscle cells from rat cerebral arteries. Whole cell potassium currents at physiological membrane potentials (-40 mV) and intracellular Ca2+ were measured simultaneously, using the perforated patch clamp technique and a laser two-dimensional (x-y) scanning confocal microscope and the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fluo-3. Virtually all (96%) detectable Ca2+ sparks were associated with the activation of a spontaneous transient outward current (STOC) through KCa channels. A small number of sparks (5 of 128) were associated with currents smaller than 6 pA (mean amplitude, 4.7 pA, at -40 mV). Approximately 41% of STOCs occurred without a detectable Ca2+ spark. The amplitudes of the Ca2+ sparks correlated with the amplitudes of the STOCs (regression coefficient 0.8; P < 0.05). The half time of decay of Ca2+ sparks (56 ms) was longer than the associated STOCs (9 ms). The mean amplitude of the STOCs, which were associated with Ca2+ sparks, was 33 pA at -40 mV. The mean amplitude of the "sparkless" STOCs was smaller, 16 pA. The very significant increase in KCa channel open probability (>10(4)-fold) during a Ca2+ spark is consistent with local Ca2+ during a spark being in the order of 1-100 microM. Therefore, the increase in fractional fluorescence (F/Fo) measured during a Ca2+ spark (mean 2.04 F/Fo or approximately 310 nM Ca2+) appears to significantly underestimate the local Ca2+ that activates KCa channels. These results indicate that the majority of ryanodine receptors that cause Ca2+ sparks are functionally coupled to KCa channels in the surface membrane, providing direct support for the idea that Ca2+ sparks cause STOCs.},

	Abstract = {The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that local Ca(2+) release events (Ca(2+) sparks) deliver high local Ca(2+) concentration to activate nearby Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) (BK) channels in the cell membrane of arterial smooth muscle cells. Ca(2+) sparks and BK channels were examined in isolated myocytes from rat cerebral arteries with laser scanning confocal microscopy and patch-clamp techniques. BK channels had an apparent dissociation constant for Ca(2+) of 19 microM and a Hill coefficient of 2.9 at -40 mV. At near-physiological intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i); 100 nM) and membrane potential (-40 mV), the open probability of a single BK channel was low (1.2 x 10(-6)). A Ca(2+) spark increased BK channel activity to 18. Assuming that 1-100% of the BK channels are activated by a single Ca(2+) spark, BK channel activity increases 6 x 10(5)-fold to 6 x 10(3)-fold, which corresponds to approximately 30 microM to 4 microM spark Ca(2+) concentration. 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester caused the disappearance of all Ca(2+) sparks while leaving the transient BK currents unchanged. Our results support the idea that Ca(2+) spark sites are in close proximity to the BK channels and that local [Ca(2+)](i) reaches micromolar levels to activate BK channels.},

	Abstract = {The electrosensory system of elasmobranchs is extremely sensitive to weak electric fields, with behavioral thresholds having been reported at voltage gradients as low as 5 nV/cm. To achieve this amazing sensitivity, the electrosensory system must extract weak extrinsic signals from a relatively large reafferent background signal associated with the animal's own movements. Ventilatory movements, in particular, strongly modulate the firing rates of primary electrosensory afferent nerve fibers, but this modulation is greatly suppressed in the medullary electrosensory processing nucleus, the dorsal octavolateral nucleus. Experimental evidence suggests that the neural basis of reafference suppression involves a common-mode rejection mechanism supplemented by an adaptive filter that fine tunes the cancellation. We present a neural model and computer simulation results that support the hypothesis that the adaptive component may involve an anti-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity at molecular layer synapses onto ascending efferent neurons, the principal output neurons of the nucleus. Parallel fibers in the molecular layer carry a wealth of proprioceptive, efference copy, and sensory signals related to the animal's own movements. The proposed adaptive mechanism acts by canceling out components of the electrosensory input signal that are consistently correlated with these internal reference signals.},

	Abstract = {Experiments were carried out to compare the amplitude and time course of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in intact slow-twitch and fast-twitch mouse fibres. Individual fibres within small bundles were injected with furaptra, a low-affinity, rapidly responding Ca2+ indicator. In response to a single action potential at 16 degrees C, the peak amplitude and half-duration of the change in myoplasmic free [Ca2+] (Delta[Ca2+]) differed significantly between fibre types (slow-twitch: peak amplitude, 9.4 +/- 1.0 microM (mean +/- S.E.M.); half-duration, 7.7 +/- 0.6 ms; fast-twitch: peak amplitude 18.5 +/- 0.5 microM; half-duration, 4.9 +/- 0.3 ms). SR Ca2+ release was estimated from Delta[Ca2+] with a computational model that calculated Ca2+ binding to the major myoplasmic Ca2+ buffers (troponin, ATP and parvalbumin); buffer concentrations and reaction rate constants were adjusted to reflect fibre-type differences. In response to an action potential, the total concentration of released Ca2+ (Delta[CaT]) and the peak rate of Ca2+ release ((d/dt)Delta[CaT]) differed about 3-fold between the fibre types (slow-twitch: Delta[CaT], 127 +/- 7 microM; (d/dt)Delta[CaT], 70 +/- 6 microM ms-1; fast-twitch: Delta[CaT], 346 +/- 6 microM; (d/dt)Delta[CaT], 212 +/- 4 microM ms-1). In contrast, the half-duration of (d/dt)Delta[CaT] was very similar in the two fibre types (slow-twitch, 1.8 +/- 0.1 ms; fast-twitch, 1.6 +/- 0.0 ms). When fibres were stimulated with a 5-shock train at 67 Hz, the peaks of (d/dt)Delta[CaT] in response to the second and subsequent shocks were much smaller than that due to the first shock; the later peaks, expressed as a fraction of the amplitude of the first peak, were similar in the two fibre types (slow-twitch, 0.2-0.3; fast-twitch, 0.1-0.3). The results support the conclusion that individual SR Ca2+ release units function similarly in slow-twitch and fast-twitch mammalian fibres.},

	Abstract = {A novel calcium-dependent potassium current (K(slow)) that slowly activates in response to a simulated islet burst was identified recently in mouse pancreatic beta-cells (G{\"o}pel, S.O., T. Kanno, S. Barg, L. Eliasson, J. Galvanovskis, E. Renstr{\"o}m, and P. Rorsman. 1999. J. Gen. Physiol. 114:759-769). K(slow) activation may help terminate the cyclic bursts of Ca(2+)-dependent action potentials that drive Ca(2+) influx and insulin secretion in beta-cells. Here, we report that when [Ca(2+)](i) handling was disrupted by blocking Ca(2+) uptake into the ER with two separate agents reported to block the sarco/endoplasmic calcium ATPase (SERCA), thapsigargin (1-5 microM) or insulin (200 nM), K(slow) was transiently potentiated and then inhibited. K(slow) amplitude could also be inhibited by increasing extracellular glucose concentration from 5 to 10 mM. The biphasic modulation of K(slow) by SERCA blockers could not be explained by a minimal mathematical model in which [Ca(2+)](i) is divided between two compartments, the cytosol and the ER, and K(slow) activation mirrors changes in cytosolic calcium induced by the burst protocol. However, the experimental findings were reproduced by a model in which K(slow) activation is mediated by a localized pool of [Ca(2+)] in a subspace located between the ER and the plasma membrane. In this model, the subspace [Ca(2+)] follows changes in cytosolic [Ca(2+)] but with a gradient that reflects Ca(2+) efflux from the ER. Slow modulation of this gradient as the ER empties and fills may enhance the role of K(slow) and [Ca(2+)] handling in influencing beta-cell electrical activity and insulin secretion.},

	Abstract = {Pancreatic beta-cells exhibit bursting oscillations with a wide range of periods. Whereas periods in isolated cells are generally either a few seconds or a few minutes, in intact islets of Langerhans they are intermediate (10-60 s). We develop a mathematical model for beta-cell electrical activity capable of generating this wide range of bursting oscillations. Unlike previous models, bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow processes, one with a relatively small time constant (1-5 s) and the other with a much larger time constant (1-2 min). Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without need for a slow process having an intermediate time constant, hence phantom bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting suitable exogenous currents. Guided by this, we devise an experimental protocol using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits islet-like, medium period oscillations from isolated cells. Finally, we show that strong electrical coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized medium bursting, suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are intrinsically either fast or slow, with few or none that are intrinsically medium.},

	Abstract = {Population density methods provide promising time-saving alternatives to direct Monte Carlo simulations of neuronal network activity, in which one tracks the state of thousands of individual neurons and synapses. A population density method has been found to be roughly a hundred times faster than direct simulation for various test networks of integrate-and-fire model neurons with instantaneous excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic conductances. In this method, neurons are grouped into large populations of similar neurons. For each population, one calculates the evolution of a probability density function (PDF) which describes the distribution of neurons over state space. The population firing rate is then given by the total flux of probability across the threshold voltage for firing an action potential. Extending the method beyond instantaneous synapses is necessary for obtaining accurate results, because synaptic kinetics play an important role in network dynamics. Embellishments incorporating more realistic synaptic kinetics for the underlying neuron model increase the dimension of the PDF, which was one-dimensional in the instantaneous synapse case. This increase in dimension causes a substantial increase in computation time to find the exact PDF, decreasing the computational speed advantage of the population density method over direct Monte Carlo simulation. We report here on a one-dimensional model of the PDF for neurons with arbitrary synaptic kinetics. The method is more accurate than the mean-field method in the steady state, where the mean-field approximation works best, and also under dynamic-stimulus conditions. The method is much faster than direct simulations. Limitations of the method are demonstrated, and possible improvements are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A previously developed method for efficiently simulating complex networks of integrate-and-fire neurons was specialized to the case in which the neurons have fast unitary postsynaptic conductances. However, inhibitory synaptic conductances are often slower than excitatory ones for cortical neurons, and this difference can have a profound effect on network dynamics that cannot be captured with neurons that have only fast synapses. We thus extend the model to include slow inhibitory synapses. In this model, neurons are grouped into large populations of similar neurons. For each population, we calculate the evolution of a probability density function (PDF), which describes the distribution of neurons over state-space. The population firing rate is given by the flux of probability across the threshold voltage for firing an action potential. In the case of fast synaptic conductances, the PDF was one-dimensional, as the state of a neuron was completely determined by its transmembrane voltage. An exact extension to slow inhibitory synapses increases the dimension of the PDF to two or three, as the state of a neuron now includes the state of its inhibitory synaptic conductance. However, by assuming that the expected value of a neuron's inhibitory conductance is independent of its voltage, we derive a reduction to a one-dimensional PDF and avoid increasing the computational complexity of the problem. We demonstrate that although this assumption is not strictly valid, the results of the reduced model are surprisingly accurate.},

	Abstract = {The elementary events of excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle are Ca2+ sparks, which arise from one or more ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Here a simple numerical model is constructed to explore Ca2+ spark formation, detection, and interpretation in cardiac myocytes. This model includes Ca2+ release, cytosolic diffusion, resequestration by SR Ca2+-ATPases, and the association and dissociation of Ca2+ with endogenous Ca2+-binding sites and a diffusible indicator dye (fluo-3). Simulations in a homogeneous, isotropic cytosol reproduce the brightness and the time course of a typical cardiac Ca2+ spark, but underestimate its spatial size (approximately 1.1 micron vs. approximately 2.0 micron). Back-calculating [Ca2+]i by assuming equilibrium with indicator fails to provide a good estimate of the free Ca2+ concentration even when using blur-free fluorescence data. A parameter sensitivity study reveals that the mobility, kinetics, and concentration of the indicator are essential determinants of the shape of Ca2+ sparks, whereas the stationary buffers and pumps are less influential. Using a geometrically more complex version of the model, we show that the asymmetric shape of Ca2+ sparks is better explained by anisotropic diffusion of Ca2+ ions and indicator dye rather than by subsarcomeric inhomogeneities of the Ca2+ buffer and transport system. In addition, we examine the contribution of off-center confocal sampling to the variance of spark statistics.},

	Abstract = {We have examined the distribution of Ca2+ in voltage-clamped cardiac myocytes under resting conditions and during the Ca2+ transient. We find that the resting Ca2+ level in a quiescent rat myocyte bathed in 1 mM extracellular Ca is relatively low (between 60 and 100 nM) and uniform. At the peak of the Ca2+ transient, Ca2+ can rise to a level as high as 600 nM to 1.0 microM. Furthermore, the magnitude of the Ca2+ transient is dependent on the size of the membrane depolarization. There is good agreement between measurements made using video imaging and those made using a photomultiplier tube for the value of intracellular Ca2+ at the peak of the Ca2+ transient and for the subsequent slow changes in intracellular Ca2+. On repolarization, intracellular Ca2+ falls with a half-time of approximately 100 ms. The uniform distribution of Ca2+ reported in the Ca2+ images of myocytes at rest and at the peak of the Ca2+ transient under normal conditions is in contrast to what is observed during "Ca2+ overload" when subcellular regions of elevated Ca2+ are observed to propagate along the cell. Thus, the measurement of [Ca2+]i in cardiac myocytes with fura-2 has already yielded important new information that was not available using other techniques to measure [Ca2+]i in cardiac ventricular muscle.},

Both types of secretion are activated by a rise in intracellular calcium but how the stimulus-secretion cascade actually regulates secretory output is not well understood. It has long been known that the calcium response of acinar cells to physiological stimulation is complex. Dependent on the type and concentration of agonist, it consists of either local or global calcium increases as well as spreading waves of calcium across the cell. In the past it has been speculated that these different calcium signals drive different secretory responses. Now, recent employment of two-photon microscopy has enabled the simultaneous recording of both enzyme secretion and calcium signals and is beginning to resolve this issue. The data shows that local calcium responses exclusively drive fluid secretion. Where-as, global calcium responses drive both fluid and enzyme secretion. This differential control of secretory output is likely central to controlling the physiological responses of pancreatic acinar cells.},

	Abstract = {Calcium dynamics are essential to a multitude of cellular processes. For many cell types, localized discharges of calcium through small clusters of intracellular channels are building blocks for all spatially extended calcium signals. Because of the large noise amplitude, the validity of noise-approximating model equations for this system has been questioned. Here we revisit the master equations for local calcium release, examine the multiple scales of calcium concentrations in the cluster domain, and derive adapted stochastic differential equations. We show by comparison of discrete and continuous trajectories that the Langevin equations can be made consistent with the master equations even for very small channel numbers. In its deterministic limit, the model reveals that excitability, a dynamical phenomenon observed in many natural systems, is at the core of calcium puffs. The model also predicts a bifurcation from transient to sustained release which may link local and global calcium signals in cells.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) sparks are small, localized cytosolic Ca(2+) transients due to Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. In smooth muscle, Ca(2+) sparks activate large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK channels) in the spark microdomain, thus generating spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs). The purpose of the present study is to determine experimentally the level of Ca(2+) to which the BK channels are exposed during a spark. Using tight seal, whole-cell recording, we have analyzed the voltage-dependence of the STOC conductance (g((STOC))), and compared it to the voltage-dependence of BK channel activation in excised patches in the presence of different [Ca(2+)]s. The Ca(2+) sparks did not change in amplitude over the range of potentials of interest. In contrast, the magnitude of g((STOC)) remained roughly constant from 20 to -40 mV and then declined steeply at more negative potentials. From this and the voltage dependence of BK channel activation, we conclude that the BK channels underlying STOCs are exposed to a mean [Ca(2+)] on the order of 10 microM during a Ca(2+) spark. The membrane area over which a concentration > or =10 microM is reached has an estimated radius of 150-300 nm, corresponding to an area which is a fraction of one square micron. Moreover, given the constraints imposed by the estimated channel density and the Ca(2+) current during a spark, the BK channels do not appear to be uniformly distributed over the membrane but instead are found at higher density at the spark site.},

	Abstract = {In airway myocytes signal transduction via cytosolic calcium plays an important role. In relation with experimental results we review models of basic molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the signal transduction from the myocyte stimulation to the activation of the contractile apparatus. We concentrate on mechanisms for encoding of input signals into Ca2+ signals and the mechanisms for their decoding. The mechanisms are arranged into a general scheme of cellular signaling, the so-called bow-tie architecture of signaling, in which calcium plays the role of a common media for cellular signals and links the encoding and decoding part. The encoding of calcium signals in airway myocytes is better known and is presented in more detail. In particular, we focus on three recent models taking into account the intracellular calcium handling and ion fluxes through the plasma membrane. The model of membrane conductances was originally proposed for predicting membrane depolarization and voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx triggered by initial cytosolic Ca2+ increase as observed on cholinergic stimulation. Cellular models of intracellular Ca2+ handling were developed to investigate the role of a mixed population of InsP3 receptor isoforms and the cellular environment in the occurrence of Ca2+ oscillations, and the respective role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and cytosolic Ca2+-binding proteins in cytosolic Ca2+ clearance. Modeling the mechanisms responsible for the decoding of calcium signals is developed in a lesser extent; however, the most recent theoretical studies are briefly presented in relation with the known experimental results.},

	Abstract = {1. Local changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] were imaged with a wide-field, high-speed, digital imaging system while membrane currents were simultaneously recorded using whole-cell, perforated patch recording in freshly dissociated guinea-pig tracheal myocytes. 2. Depending on membrane potential, Ca2+ sparks triggered 'spontaneous' transient inward currents (STICs), 'spontaneous' transient outward currents (STOCs) and biphasic currents in which the outward phase always preceded the inward (STOICs). The outward currents resulted from the opening of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels and the inward currents from Ca2+-activated Cl- (ClCa) channels. 3. A single Ca2+ spark elicited both phases of a STOIC, and sparks originating from the same site triggered STOCs, STICs and STOICs, depending on membrane potential. 4. STOCs had a shorter time to peak (TTP) than Ca2+ sparks and a much shorter half-time of decay. In contrast, STICs had a somewhat longer TTP than sparks but the same half-time of decay. Thus, the STIC, not the STOC, more closely reflected the time course of cytosolic Ca2+ elevation during a Ca2+ spark. 5. These findings suggest that ClCa channels and BK channels may be organized spatially in quite different ways in relation to points of Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. The results also suggest that Ca2+ sparks may have functions in smooth muscle not previously suggested, such as a stabilizing effect on membrane potential and hence on the contractile state of the cell, or as activators of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels due to depolarization mediated by STICs.},

	Abstract = {Calcium signalling in smooth muscles is complex, but our understanding of it has increased markedly in recent years. Thus, progress has been made in relating global Ca2+ signals to changes in force in smooth muscles and understanding the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in Ca2+ sensitization, i.e. altering the relation between Ca2+ and force. Attention is now focussed more on the role of the internal Ca2+ store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), global Ca2+ signals and control of excitability. Modern imaging techniques have shown the elaborate SR network in smooth muscles, along with the expression of IP3 and ryanodine receptors. The role and cross-talk between these two Ca(2+) release mechanisms, as well as possible compartmentalization of the SR Ca2+ store are discussed. The close proximity between SR and surface membrane has long been known but the details of this special region to Ca2+ signalling and the role of local sub-membrane Ca2+ concentrations and membrane microdomains are only now emerging. The activation of K+ and Cl- channels by local Ca2+ signals, can have profound effects on excitability and hence contraction. We examine the evidence for both Ca2+ sparks and puffs in controlling ion channel activity, as well as a fundamental role for Ca2+ sparks in governing the period of inexcitability in smooth muscle, i.e. the refractory period. Finally, the relation between different Ca2+ signals, e.g. sparks, waves and transients, to smooth muscle activity in health and disease is becoming clearer and will be discussed.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) sparks are highly localized Ca(2+) transients caused by Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors (RyR). In smooth muscle, Ca(2+) sparks activate nearby large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) (BK) channels to generate spontaneous transient outward currents (STOC). The properties of individual sites that give rise to Ca(2+) sparks have not been examined systematically. We have characterized individual sites in amphibian gastric smooth muscle cells with simultaneous high-speed imaging of Ca(2+) sparks using wide-field digital microscopy and patch-clamp recording of STOC in whole cell mode. We used a signal mass approach to measure the total Ca(2+) released at a site and to estimate the Ca(2+) current flowing through RyR [I(Ca(spark))]. The variance between spark sites was significantly greater than the intrasite variance for the following parameters: Ca(2+) signal mass, I(Ca(spark)), STOC amplitude, and 5-ms isochronic STOC amplitude. Sites that failed to generate STOC did so consistently, while those at the remaining sites generated STOC without failure, allowing the sites to be divided into STOC-generating and STOC-less sites. We also determined the average number of spark sites, which was 42/cell at a minimum and more likely on the order of at least 400/cell. We conclude that 1) spark sites differ in the number of RyR, BK channels, and coupling ratio of RyR-BK channels, and 2) there are numerous Ca(2+) spark-generating sites in smooth muscle cells. The implications of these findings for the organization of the spark microdomain are explored.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) sparks are highly localized cytosolic Ca(2+) transients caused by a release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors (RyRs); they are the elementary events underlying global changes in Ca(2+) in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In smooth muscle and some neurons, Ca(2+) sparks activate large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK channels) in the spark microdomain, causing spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) that regulate membrane potential and, hence, voltage-gated channels. Using the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator fluo-3 and a high speed widefield digital imaging system, it was possible to capture the total increase in fluorescence (i.e., the signal mass) during a spark in smooth muscle cells, which is the first time such a direct approach has been used in any system. The signal mass is proportional to the total quantity of Ca(2+) released into the cytosol, and its rate of rise is proportional to the Ca(2+) current flowing through the RyRs during a spark (I(Ca(spark))). Thus, Ca(2+) currents through RyRs can be monitored inside the cell under physiological conditions. Since the magnitude of I(Ca(spark)) in different sparks varies more than fivefold, Ca(2+) sparks appear to be caused by the concerted opening of a number of RyRs. Sparks with the same underlying Ca(2+) current cause STOCs, whose amplitudes vary more than threefold, a finding that is best explained by variability in coupling ratio (i.e., the ratio of RyRs to BK channels in the spark microdomain). The time course of STOC decay is approximated by a single exponential that is independent of the magnitude of signal mass and has a time constant close to the value of the mean open time of the BK channels, suggesting that STOC decay reflects BK channel kinetics, rather than the time course of [Ca(2+)] decline at the membrane. Computer simulations were carried out to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of the Ca(2+) concentration resulting from the measured range of I(Ca(spark)). At the onset of a spark, the Ca(2+) concentration within 200 nm of the release site reaches a plateau or exceeds the [Ca(2+)](EC50) for the BK channels rapidly in comparison to the rate of rise of STOCs. These findings suggest a model in which the BK channels lie close to the release site and are exposed to a saturating [Ca(2+)] with the rise and fall of the STOCs determined by BK channel kinetics. The mechanism of signaling between RyRs and BK channels may provide a model for Ca(2+) action on a variety of molecular targets within cellular microdomains.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the phenomenon of Ca(2+) sensitization, we developed a new intact airway and arteriole smooth muscle cell (SMC) "model" by treating murine lung slices with ryanodine-receptor antagonist, ryanodine (50 microM), and caffeine (20 mM). A sustained elevation in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was induced in both SMC types by the ryanodine-caffeine treatment due to the depletion of internal Ca(2+) stores and the stimulation of a persistent influx of Ca(2+). Arterioles responded to this sustained increase in [Ca(2+)](i) with a sustained contraction. By contrast, airways responded to sustained high [Ca(2+)](i) with a transient contraction followed by relaxation. Subsequent exposure to methacholine (MCh) induced a sustained concentration-dependent contraction of the airway without a change in the [Ca(2+)](i). During sustained MCh-induced contraction, Y-27632 (a Rho-kinase inhibitor) and GF-109203X (a protein kinase C inhibitor) induced a concentration-dependent relaxation without changing the [Ca(2+)](i). The cAMP-elevating agents, forskolin (an adenylyl cyclase activator), IBMX (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), and caffeine (also acting as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), exerted similar relaxing effects. These results indicate that 1) ryanodine-caffeine treatment is a valuable tool for investigating the contractile mechanisms of SMCs while avoiding nonspecific effects due to cell permeabilization, 2) in the absence of agonist, sustained high [Ca(2+)](i) has a differential time-dependent effect on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of airway and arteriole SMCs, 3) MCh facilitates the contraction of airway SMCs by inducing Ca(2+) sensitization via the activation of Rho-kinase and protein kinase C, and 4) cAMP-elevating agents contribute to the relaxation of airway SMCs through Ca(2+) desensitization.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been shown that the contractile state of airway smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in response to agonists is determined by the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations occurring within the SMCs. Therefore, we hypothesized that the relaxation of airway SMCs induced by agents that increase cAMP results from the down-regulation or slowing of the frequency of the Ca2+ oscillations.
METHODS: The effects of isoproterenol (ISO), forskolin (FSK) and 8-bromo-cAMP on the relaxation and Ca2+ signaling of airway SMCs contracted with methacholine (MCh) was investigated in murine lung slices with phase-contrast and laser scanning microscopy.
RESULTS: All three cAMP-elevating agents simultaneously induced a reduction in the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations within the SMCs and the relaxation of contracted airways. The decrease in the Ca2+ oscillation frequency correlated with the extent of airway relaxation and was concentration-dependent. The mechanism by which cAMP reduced the frequency of the Ca2+ oscillations was investigated. Elevated cAMP did not affect the re-filling rate of the internal Ca2+ stores after emptying by repetitive exposure to 20 mM caffeine. Neither did elevated cAMP limit the Ca2+ available to stimulate contraction because an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration induced by exposure to a Ca2+ ionophore (ionomycin) or by photolysis of caged-Ca2+ did not reverse the effect of cAMP. Similar results were obtained with iberiotoxin, a blocker of Ca2+-activated K+ channels, which would be expected to increase Ca2+ influx and contraction. By contrast, the photolysis of caged-IP3 in the presence of agonist, to further elevate the intracellular IP3 concentration, reversed the slowing of the frequency of the Ca2+ oscillations and relaxation of the airway induced by FSK. This result implied that the sensitivity of the IP3R to IP3 was reduced by FSK and this was supported by the reduced ability of IP3 to release Ca2+ in SMCs in the presence of FSK.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the relaxant effect of cAMP-elevating agents on airway SMCs is achieved by decreasing the Ca2+ oscillation frequency by reducing internal Ca2+ release through IP3 receptors.},

	Abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) induces airway smooth muscle cell (SMC) relaxation, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Consequently, we investigated the effects of NO on airway SMC contraction, Ca(2+) signaling, and Ca(2+) sensitivity in mouse lung slices with phase-contrast and confocal microscopy. Airways that were contracted in response to the agonist 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transiently relaxed in response to the NO donor, NOC-5. This NO-induced relaxation was enhanced by zaprinast or vardenafil, two selective inhibitors of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase-5, but blocked by ODQ, an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, and by Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, an inhibitor of protein kinase G (PKG). Simultaneous measurements of airway caliber and SMC [Ca(2+)](i) revealed that airway contraction induced by 5-HT correlated with the occurrence of Ca(2+) oscillations in the airway SMCs. Airway relaxation induced by NOC-5 was accompanied by a decrease in the frequency of these Ca(2+) oscillations. The cGMP analogues and selective PKG activators 8Br-cGMP and 8pCPT-cGMP also induced airway relaxation and decreased the frequency of the Ca(2+) oscillations. NOC-5 inhibited the increase of [Ca(2+)](i) and contraction induced by the photolytic release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) in airway SMCs. The effect of NO on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the airway SMCs was examined in lung slices permeabilized to Ca(2+) by treatment with caffeine and ryanodine. Neither NOC-5 nor 8pCPT-cGMP induced relaxation in agonist-contracted Ca(2+)-permeabilized airways. Consequently, we conclude that NO, acting via the cGMP-PKG pathway, induced airway SMC relaxation by predominately inhibiting the release of Ca(2+) via the IP(3) receptor to decrease the frequency of agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Airway smooth muscle cell (ASMC) contraction is regulated by myosin phosphorylation to control actin-myosin cross-bridge activity. Myosin phosphorylation is determined by the antagonistic activity of myosin light chain (MLC) kinase (MLCK) and phosphatase (MLCP). MLCK activity is increased by increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) associated with Ca2+ oscillations. MLCP activity is decreased by phosphorylation of MLCP or accessory proteins by kinases, including Rho-kinase or protein kinase C. During agonist-induced ASMC contraction, these 2 pathways are simultaneously activated. Because MLCP activity is often independent of [Ca2+]i, changes in MLCP activity can alter ASMC tone at a constant [Ca2+]i; a behavior termed Ca2+ sensitivity. In asthma, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) may result from an increase in the Ca2+-dependent contractile mechanisms and/or the Ca2+ sensitivity of ASMCs. Conversely, inhalation of beta2-adrenergic agonists induce airway relaxation by simultaneously slowing the Ca2+ oscillations and reducing the Ca2+ sensitivity of ASMCs. However, the action of beta2-adrenergic agonists varies with species. Consequently, the development of beta2-adrenergic agonists requires a characterization of their action in human airways.},

	Abstract = {To determine the relative contributions of Ca(2+) signaling and Ca(2+) sensitivity to the contractility of airway smooth muscle cells (SMCs), we compared the contractile responses of mouse and rat airways with the lung slice technique. Airway contraction was measured by monitoring changes in airway lumen area with phase-contrast microscopy, whereas changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) of the SMCs were recorded with laser scanning microscopy. In mice and rats, methacholine (MCh) or serotonin induced concentration-dependent airway contraction and Ca(2+) oscillations in the SMCs. However, rat airways demonstrated greater contraction compared with mice, in response to agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations of a similar frequency. Because this indicates that rat airway SMCs have a higher Ca(2+) sensitivity compared with mice, we examined Ca(2+) sensitivity with Ca(2+)-permeabilized airway SMCs in which the [Ca(2+)](i) was experimentally controlled. In the absence of agonists, high [Ca(2+)](i) induced a sustained contraction in rat airways but only a transient contraction in mouse airways. This sustained contraction of rat airways was relaxed by Y-23672, a Rho kinase inhibitor, but not affected by GF-109203X, a PKC inhibitor. The subsequent exposure of Ca(2+)-permeabilized airway SMCs, with high [Ca(2+)](i), to MCh elicited a further contraction of rat airways and initiated a sustained contraction of mouse airways, without changing the [Ca(2+)](i) of the SMCs. Collectively, these results indicate that airway SMCs of rats have a substantially higher innate Ca(2+) sensitivity than mice and that this strongly influences the transduction of the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations into the contractility of airway SMCs.},

	Abstract = {The multiplicity of mechanisms involved in regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in smooth muscle results in both intra- and intercellular heterogeneities in [Ca(2+)](i). Heterogeneity in [Ca(2+)](i) regulation is reflected by the presence of spontaneous, localized [Ca(2+)](i) transients (Ca(2+) sparks) representing Ca(2+) release through ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels. Ca(2+) sparks display variable spatial Ca(2+) distributions with every occurrence within and across cellular regions. Individual sparks are often grouped, and fusion of sparks produces large local elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) that occasionally trigger propagating [Ca(2+)](i) waves. Ca(2+) sparks may modulate membrane potential and thus smooth muscle contractility. Sparks may also be the target of other regulatory factors in smooth muscle. Agonists induce propagating [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations that originate from foci with high spark incidence and also represent Ca(2+) release through RyR channels. With increasing agonist concentration, the peak of regional [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations remains relatively constant, whereas both frequency and propagation velocity increase. In contrast, the global cellular response appears as a concentration-dependent increase in peak as well as mean cellular [Ca(2+)](i), representing a spatial and temporal integration of the oscillations. The significance of agonist-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations lies in the establishment of a global [Ca(2+)](i) level for slower Ca(2+)-dependent physiological processes.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Volatile anesthetics produce bronchodilation in part by depleting sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca stores in airway smooth muscle (ASM). Other bronchodilatory drugs are known to act via cyclic nucleotides (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, cyclic guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate). Intracellular Ca regulation in ASM involves plasma membrane Ca influx, including that triggered by sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca depletion (store-operated Ca entry [SOCE]). The authors hypothesized that anesthetics and bronchodilatory agents interact in inhibiting SOCE, thus enhancing ASM relaxation.
METHODS: In enzymatically dissociated porcine ASM cells imaged using fluorescence microscopy, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca was depleted by 1 microm cyclopiazonic acid in 0 extracellular Ca, nifedipine, and potassium chloride (preventing Ca influx through L-type channels and SOCE). Extracellular Ca was rapidly reintroduced to selectively activate SOCE in the presence or absence of 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. Anesthetic interference with SOCE regulation by cyclic nucleotides was examined by activating SOCE in the presence of (1) 1 microm acetylcholine, (2) 100 microm dibutryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, or (3) 100 microm 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate.
RESULTS: SOCE was enhanced by acetylcholine, whereas volatile anesthetics and both cyclic nucleotides partially inhibited Ca influx. Preexposure to 1 or 2 MAC anesthetic (halothane > isoflurane > sevoflurane) inhibited SOCE. Only halothane and isoflurane inhibited acetylcholine-induced augmentation of Ca influx, and significantly potentiated cyclic nucleotide inhibition such that no influx was observed in the presence of anesthetics and cyclic nucleotides.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that volatile anesthetics prevent sarcoplasmic reticulum refilling by inhibiting SOCE and enhancing cyclic nucleotide blunting of Ca influx in ASM. Such interactions likely result in substantial airway relaxation in the presence of both anesthetics and bronchodilatory agents such as beta agonists or nitric oxide.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vasomotion consists in cyclic oscillations of the arterial diameter induced by the synchronized activity of the smooth muscle cells. So far, contradictory results have emerged in the literature about the role of the endothelium in the onset and maintenance of vasomotion. Here our aim is to understand how the endothelium may either abolish or promote vasomotion.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigate rat mesenteric arterial strips stimulated with phenylephrine (PE). Our results show that the endothelium is not necessary for vasomotion. However, when the endothelium is removed, the PE concentration needed to induce vasomotion is lower and the rhythmic contractions occur for a narrower range of PE concentrations. We demonstrate that endothelium-derived relaxing products may either induce or abolish vasomotion. On the one hand, when the strip is tonically contracted in a nonoscillating state, an endothelium-derived relaxation may induce vasomotion. On the other hand, if the strip displays vasomotion with a medium mean contraction, a relaxation may induce a transition to a nonoscillating state with a small contraction.
CONCLUSION: Our findings clarify the role of the endothelium on vasomotion and reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations reported in the literature.},

	Abstract = {It is well-known that cyclic variations of the vascular diameter, a phenomenon called vasomotion, are induced by synchronous calcium oscillations of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of the endothelium on vasomotion is unclear. Some experimental studies claim that the endothelium is necessary for synchronization and vasomotion, whereas others report rhythmic contractions in the absence of an intact endothelium. Moreover, endothelium-derived factors have been shown to abolish vasomotion by desynchronizing the calcium signals in SMCs. By modeling the calcium dynamics of a population of SMCs coupled to a population of endothelial cells, we analyze the effects of an SMC vasoconstrictor stimulation on endothelial cells and the feedback of endothelium-derived factors. Our results show that the endothelium essentially decreases the SMCs calcium level and may move the SMCs from a steady state to an oscillatory domain, and vice versa. In the oscillatory domain, a population of coupled SMCs exhibits synchronous calcium oscillations. Outside the oscillatory domain, the coupled SMCs present only irregular calcium flashings arising from noise modeling stochastic opening of channels. Our findings provide explanations for the published contradictory experimental observations.},

	Abstract = {To study the effect of myoendothelial communication on vascular reactivity, we integrated detailed mathematical models of Ca(2+) dynamics and membrane electrophysiology in arteriolar smooth muscle (SMC) and endothelial (EC) cells. Cells are coupled through the exchange of Ca(2+), Cl(-), K(+), and Na(+) ions, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)), and the paracrine diffusion of nitric oxide (NO). EC stimulation reduces intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in the SMC by transmitting a hyperpolarizing current carried primarily by K(+). The NO-independent endothelium-derived hyperpolarization was abolished in a synergistic-like manner by inhibition of EC SK(Ca) and IK(Ca) channels. During NE stimulation, IP(3) diffusing from the SMC induces EC Ca(2+) release, which, in turn, moderates SMC depolarization and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. On the contrary, SMC [Ca(2+)](i) was not affected by EC-derived IP(3). Myoendothelial Ca(2+) fluxes had no effect in either cell. The EC exerts a stabilizing effect on calcium-induced calcium release-dependent SMC Ca(2+) oscillations by increasing the norepinephrine concentration window for oscillations. We conclude that a model based on independent data for subcellular components can capture major features of the integrated vessel behavior. This study provides a tissue-specific approach for analyzing complex signaling mechanisms in the vasculature.},

	Abstract = {A network of intracellular signaling pathways and complex intercellular interactions regulate calcium mobilization in vascular cells, arteriolar tone, and blood flow. Different endothelium-derived vasoreactive factors have been identified and the importance of myoendothelial communication in vasoreactivity is now well appreciated. The ability of many vascular networks to conduct signals upstream also is established. This phenomenon is critical for both short-term changes in blood perfusion as well as long-term adaptations of a vascular network. In addition, in a phenomenon termed vasomotion, arterioles often exhibit spontaneous oscillations in diameter. This is thought to improve tissue oxygenation and enhance blood flow. Experimentation has begun to reveal important aspects of the regulatory machinery and the significance of these phenomena for the regulation of local perfusion and oxygenation. Mathematical modeling can assist in elucidating the complex signaling mechanisms that participate in these phenomena. This review highlights some of the important experimental studies and relevant mathematical models that provide the current understanding of these mechanisms in vasoreactivity.},

	Abstract = {In GnRH-secreting (GT1) neurons, activation of Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptors induces a sustained membrane depolarization that shifts the profile of the action potential (AP) waveform from sharp, high-amplitude to broad, low-amplitude spikes. Here we characterize this shift in the firing pattern and its impact on Ca(2+) influx experimentally by using prerecorded sharp and broad APs as the voltage-clamp command pulse. As a quantitative test of the experimental data, a mathematical model based on the membrane and ionic current properties of GT1 neurons was also used. Both experimental and modeling results indicated that inactivation of the tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) channels by sustained depolarization accounted for a reduction in the amplitude of the spike upstroke. The ensuing decrease in tetraethylammonium-sensitive K(+) current activation slowed membrane repolarization, leading to AP broadening. This change in firing pattern increased the total L-type Ca(2+) current and facilitated AP-driven Ca(2+) entry. The leftward shift in the current-voltage relation of the L-type Ca(2+) channels expressed in GT1 cells allowed the depolarization-induced AP broadening to facilitate Ca(2+) entry despite a decrease in spike amplitude. Thus the gating properties of the L-type Ca(2+) channels expressed in GT1 neurons are suitable for promoting AP-driven Ca(2+) influx in receptor- and non-receptor-depolarized cells.},

@article{van-goor1999,
	Abstract = {An analysis of the relationship between electrical membrane activity and Ca2+ influx in differentiated GnRH-secreting (GT1) neurons revealed that most cells exhibited spontaneous, extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent action potentials (APs). Spiking was initiated by a slow pacemaker depolarization from a baseline potential between -75 and -50 mV, and AP frequency increased with membrane depolarization. More hyperpolarized cells fired sharp APs with limited capacity to promote Ca2+ influx, whereas more depolarized cells fired broad APs with enhanced capacity for Ca2+ influx. Characterization of the inward currents in GT1 cells revealed the presence of tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+, Ni(2+)-sensitive T-type Ca2+, and dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ components. The availability of Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels was dependent on the baseline potential, which determined the activation/inactivation status of these channels. Whereas all three channels were involved in the generation of sharp APs, L-type channels were solely responsible for the spike depolarization in cells exhibiting broad APs. Activation of GnRH receptors led to biphasic changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), with an early, extracellular Ca(2+)-independent peak and a sustained, extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent phase. During the peak [Ca2+]i response, electrical activity was abolished due to transient hyperpolarization. This was followed by sustained depolarization of cells and resumption of firing of increased frequency with a shift from sharp to broad APs. The GnRH-induced change in firing pattern accounted for about 50% of the elevated Ca2+ influx, the remainder being independent of spiking. Basal [Ca2+]i was also dependent on Ca2+ influx through AP-driven and voltage-insensitive pathways. Thus, in both resting and agonist-stimulated GT1 cells, membrane depolarization limits the participation of Na+ and T-type channels in firing, but facilitates AP-driven Ca2+ influx.},

@article{lee2012,
	Abstract = {Burst firing is a feature of many neuroendocrine cell types, including the hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurones that control fertility. The role of intrinsic and extrinsic influences in generating GnRH neurone burst firing is presently unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of fast amino acid transmission in burst firing by examining the effects of receptor antagonists on bursting displayed by green fluorescent protein GnRH neurones in sagittal brain slices prepared from adult male mice. Blockade of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors with a cocktail of CNQX and AP5 was found to have no effects on burst firing in GnRH neurones. The frequency of bursts, dynamics of individual bursts, or percentage of firing clustered in bursts was not altered. Similarly, GABA(A) receptor antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin had no effects upon burst firing in GnRH neurones. To examine the importance of both glutamate and GABA ionotrophic signalling, a cocktail including picrotoxin, CNQX and AP5 was used but, again, this was found to have no effects on GnRH neurone burst firing. To further question the impact of endogenous amino acid release on burst firing, electrical activation of anteroventral periventricular nuclei GABA/glutamate inputs to GnRH neurones was undertaken and found to have no impact on burst firing. Taken together, these observations indicate that bursting in GnRH neurones is not dependent upon acute ionotrophic GABA and glutamate signalling and suggest that extrinsic inputs to GnRH neurones acting through AMPA, NMDA and GABA(A) receptors are unlikely to be required for burst initiation in these cells.},

@article{herde2013,
	Abstract = {Information processing by neurons has been traditionally envisioned to occur in discrete neuronal compartments. Specifically, dendrites receive and integrate synaptic inputs while axons initiate and conduct spikes to distal neuronal targets. We report here in mice, using morphological reconstructions and electrophysiology, that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that control mammalian fertility do not conform to this stereotype and instead possess a single projection structure that functions simultaneously as an axon and dendrite. Specifically, we show that the GnRH neuron projection to the median eminence to control pituitary hormone secretion possesses a spike initiation site and conducts action potentials while also exhibiting spines and synaptic appositions along its entire length. Classical axonal or dendritic markers are not detectable in the projection process. Activation of ionotropic glutamate and/or GABA receptors along the GnRH neuron projection is capable of depolarizing the membrane potential and initiating action potentials. In addition, focal glutamate application to the projection is able to regulate the width of propagating spikes. These data demonstrate that GnRH neurons elaborate a previously uncharacterized neuronal projection that functions simultaneously as an axon and dendrite. This structure, termed a "dendron," greatly expands the dynamic control of GnRH secretion into the pituitary portal system to regulate fertility.},

	Abstract = {The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the key cells regulating fertility in all mammalian species. The scattered distribution of these neurons has made investigation of their properties extremely difficult and the key goal of recording their electrical activity in vivo near impossible. The caudal-most extension of the GnRH neuron continuum brings some cells very close to the base of the brain at the level of the anterior hypothalamic area. Taking insight from this, we developed an experimental procedure in anesthetized GnRH-GFP mice that allows the electrical activity of these GnRH neurons to be recorded in vivo. On-cell recordings revealed that the majority of GnRH neurons (86%) were spontaneously active, exhibiting a range of firing patterns, although only a minority (15%) exhibited burst firing. Mean firing frequencies ranged from 0.06 to 3.65 Hz, with the most common interspike interval being ~500 ms. All GnRH neurons tested were activated by AMPA and kisspeptin. Whereas the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol evoked excitatory, inhibitory, or mixed effects on GnRH neuron firing, the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin resulted in a consistent suppression of firing. These observations represent the first electrical recordings of GnRH neurons in vivo. They reveal that GnRH neurons in vivo exhibit considerable heterogeneity in their firing patterns with both similarities and differences to firing in vitro. These variable patterns of firing in vivo are found to be critically dependent upon ongoing GABAA receptor signaling.},

	Abstract = {The GnRH neurons exhibit long dendrites and project to the median eminence. The aim of the present study was to generate an acute brain slice preparation that enabled recordings to be undertaken from GnRH neurons maintaining the full extent of their dendrites or axons. A thick, horizontal brain slice was developed, in which it was possible to record from the horizontally oriented GnRH neurons located in the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA). In vivo studies showed that the majority of AHA GnRH neurons projected outside the blood-brain barrier and expressed c-Fos at the time of the GnRH surge. On-cell recordings compared AHA GnRH neurons in the horizontal slice (AHAh) with AHA and preoptic area (POA) GnRH neurons in coronal slices [POA coronal (POAc) and AHA coronal (AHAc), respectively]. AHAh GnRH neurons exhibited tighter burst firing compared with other slice orientations. Although α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) excited GnRH neurons in all preparations, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was excitatory in AHAc and POAc but inhibitory in AHAh slices. GABA(A) receptor postsynaptic currents were the same in AHAh and AHAc slices. Intriguingly, direct activation of GABA(A) or GABA(B) receptors respectively stimulated and inhibited GnRH neurons regardless of slice orientation. Subsequent experiments indicated that net GABA effects were determined by differences in the ratio of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor-mediated effects in "long" and "short" dendrites of GnRH neurons in the different slice orientations. These studies document a new brain slice preparation for recording from GnRH neurons with their extensive dendrites/axons and highlight the importance of GnRH neuron orientation relative to the angle of brain slicing in studying these neurons in vitro.},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the final output neurons in a complex neuronal network that regulates fertility. The morphology of GnRH neuron dendrites is very different to other central neurons in that they are very long, thin, and unbranched. To study the function of these dendrites, we have used Na(+) and Ca(2+) imaging in combination with dual soma and dendrite electrical recordings in brain slices from GnRH-GFP mice. Here, we show that GnRH neurons actively propagate Na(+) spikes throughout their dendrites. Multisite dendritic recordings confirmed that these spikes were observed in one of the dendrites before the soma in the great majority of neurons tested. Na(+) imaging experiments revealed that the initial 150 μm of dendrite has a higher density of functional Na(+) channels than more distal regions, suggesting that this region of dendrite is highly excitable and may be the site of spike initiation. Finally, we show that the depolarization from dendritic spikes opens voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels giving rise to dendritic Ca(2+) transients. Together, these findings suggest that the proximal dendrites of GnRH neurons are highly excitable and are likely to be the site of action potential initiation in these neurons.},

Using perturbation theory, we compute the mean and the variance for PRCs for arbitrary limit cycle oscillators when the noise is small. Phase resetting curves and phase dependent variance are fit to experimental data and the variance is computed using an ad-hoc method. The theoretical curves of this phase dependent method match both simulations and experimental data significantly better than an ad-hoc method. A dual cell network simulation is compared to predictions using the analytical phase dependent variance estimation presented in this paper. We also discuss how entrainment of a neuron to a periodic pulse depends on the noise amplitude.},

By exploiting the special structure of PRCs, we obtain some approximations for the invariant distributions. Comparisons to Monte-Carlo simulations are made.

	Abstract = {A mathematical model for the perturbation of a biological oscillator by single and periodic impulses is analyzed. In response to a single stimulus the phase of the oscillator is changed. If the new phase following a stimulus is plotted against the old phase the resulting curve is called the phase transition curve or PTC (Pavlidis, 1973). There are two qualitatively different types of phase resetting. Using the terminology of Winfree (1977, 1980), large perturbations give a type 0 PTC (average slope of the PTC equals zero), whereas small perturbations give a type 1 PTC. The effects of periodic inputs can be analyzed by using the PTC to construct the Poincar{\'e} or phase advance map. Over a limited range of stimulation frequency and amplitude, the Poincar{\'e} map can be reduced to an interval map possessing a single maximum. Over this range there are period doubling bifurcations as well as chaotic dynamics. Numerical and analytical studies of the Poincar{\'e} map show that both phase locked and non-phase locked dynamics occur. We propose that cardiac dysrhythmias may arise from desynchronization of two or more spontaneously oscillating regions of the heart. This hypothesis serves to account for the various forms of atrioventricular (AV) block clinically observed. In particular 2:2 and 4:2 AV block can arise by period doubling bifurcations, and intermittent or variable AV block may be due to the complex irregular behavior associated with chaotic dynamics.},

@article{sun2011,
	Abstract = {The activation of vertebrate development at fertilization relies on IP₃-dependent Ca²⁺ release, a pathway that is sensitized during oocyte maturation. This sensitization has been shown to correlate with the remodeling of the endoplasmic reticulum into large ER patches, however the mechanisms involved are not clear. Here we show that IP₃ receptors within ER patches have a higher sensitivity to IP₃ than those in the neighboring reticular ER. The lateral diffusion rate of IP₃ receptors in both ER domains is similar, and ER patches dynamically fuse with reticular ER, arguing that IP₃ receptors exchange freely between the two ER compartments. These results suggest that increasing the density of IP₃ receptors through ER remodeling is sufficient to sensitize IP₃-dependent Ca²⁺ release. Mathematical modeling supports this concept of 'geometric sensitization' of IP₃ receptors as a population, and argues that it depends on enhanced Ca²⁺-dependent cooperativity at sub-threshold IP₃ concentrations. This represents a novel mechanism of tuning the sensitivity of IP₃ receptors through ER remodeling during meiosis.},

@article{whitcomb2004,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple, physiologically based mathematical model of pancreatic duct cell secretion using experimentally derived parameters that generates pancreatic fluid bicarbonate concentrations of >140 mM after CFTR activation.
METHODS: A new mathematical model was developed simulating a duct cell within a proximal pancreatic duct and included a sodium-2-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) and sodium-potassium pump (NaK pump) on a chloride-impermeable basolateral membrane, CFTR on the luminal membrane with 0.2 to 1 bicarbonate to chloride permeability ratio. Chloride-bicarbonate antiporters (Cl/HCO3 AP) were added or subtracted from the basolateral (APb) and luminal (APl) membranes. The model was integrated over time using XPPAUT.
RESULTS: This model predicts robust, NaK pump-dependent bicarbonate secretion with opening of the CFTR, generates and maintains pancreatic fluid secretion with bicarbonate concentrations >140 mM, and returns to basal levels with CFTR closure. Limiting CFTR permeability to bicarbonate, as seen in some CFTR mutations, markedly inhibited pancreatic bicarbonate and fluid secretion.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple CFTR-dependent duct cell model can explain active, high-volume, high-concentration bicarbonate secretion in pancreatic juice that reproduces the experimental findings. This model may also provide insight into why CFTR mutations that predominantly affect bicarbonate permeability predispose to pancreatic dysfunction in humans.},

	Abstract = {A simple transporting epithelium is represented as a cellular compartment, compliant in all dimensions, and a paracellular channel, of arbitrary shape, between well-stirred mucosal ans serosal baths. The equations for mass balance, Poiseuille flow, and the Nernst-Planck equation are used to describe the continuous behavior of the system along cell and channel, whereas passive transport across membranes is given by the relations of Kedem and Katchalsky. Time-dependent terms are retained to permit study of transient phenomena. Boundary conditions at the baths demand only mass conservation and specify no a priori estimates of the system variables. A numerical model containing Na+,K+,Cl-, and impermeant cellular anions is formulated with membrane parameters taken from the literature on Necturus gallbladder. The differential equations are represented as a finite difference scheme and solved using Newton's method. It appears that apical cellular NaCl cotransport is necessary to obtain a reasonable cell chloride concentration. Investigation of the osmolality of the transepithelial flow shows that at steady state a leaky epithelium cannot separate baths of substantially different tonicity, although this does not guarantee isotonic transport between equiosmolar media. Changes in bath pressure, application of transepithelial electrical potential, and simulation of ion-substitution experiments are performed to understand the role of membrane permeabilities in determining the dynamic behavior of the epithelium.},

These junctions, the loss of which might contribute to vascular aging and disease, provide a platform for ion metabolism signalplexes and the interaction of localized Na+ and Ca2+ gradients. We moreover suggest the existence in the junctions of a Na+ diffusional barrier as a necessary condition for the generation of LNats. LNats are likely a fundamental feature of near membrane ion signaling in many cell types, and their discovery offers new possibilities for elucidating the mechanism, function and pathogenesis of Na+ and Ca2+ signaling nanodomains.},

	Abstract = {We present a stochastic computational model to study the mechanism of signaling between a source and a target ionic transporter, both localized on the plasma membrane (PM). In general this requires a nanometer-scale cytoplasmic space, or nanodomain, between the PM and a peripheral organelle to reflect ions back towards the PM. Specifically we investigate the coupling between Na(+) entry via the transient receptor potential canonical channel 6 (TRPC6) and the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), a process which is essential for reloading the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) and maintaining Ca(2+) oscillations in activated vascular smooth muscle. Having previously modeled the flow of Ca(2+) between reverse NCX and SERCA during SR refilling, this quantitative approach now allows us to model the upstream linkage of Na(+) entry through TRPC6 to reversal of NCX. We have implemented a random walk (RW) Monte Carlo (MC) model with simulations mimicking a diffusion process originating at the TRPC6 within PM-SR junctions. The model calculates the average Na(+) in the nanospace and also produces profiles as a function of distance from the source. Our results highlight the necessity of a strategic juxtaposition of the relevant ion translocators as well as other physical structures within the nanospaces to permit adequate Na(+) build-up to initiate NCX reversal and Ca(2+) influx to refill the SR.},

Increasingly more convincing evidence supports the view that these nanospaces--nanometre-scale spaces between organellar membranes, hosting cell signalling machinery--are key to Ca(2+) signalling as much as Ca(2+) transporters and Ca(2+) storing organelles. Our research suggests that the origin of certain diseases is to be sought in the disruption of the proper functioning of cytoplasmic nanospaces. We begin with a historical perspective on the study of smooth muscle cell plasma membrane-sarcoplasmic reticulum nanospaces, including experimental evidence of their role in the generation of asynchronous Ca(2+) waves. We then summarize how stochastic modelling approaches have aided and guided our understanding of two basic functional steps leading to healthy smooth muscle cell contraction. We furthermore outline how more sophisticated and realistic quantitative stochastic modelling is now being employed not only to deepen our understanding but also to aid in the hypothesis generation for further experimental investigation.},

	Abstract = {Vesicle fusion and transmitter release at synapses is driven by a highly localized Ca2+ signal that rapidly builds up around open Ca2+-channels at and near presynaptic active zones. It has been difficult to estimate the amplitude and the kinetics of this 'microdomain' signal by direct Ca2+-imaging approaches. Recently, Ca2+ uncaging at large CNS synapses, among them the calyx of Held, has shown that the intrinsic cooperativity of Ca2+ in inducing vesicle fusion is high, with 4-5 Ca2+ ions needed to trigger vesicle fusion. Given the Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion as determined by Ca2+-uncaging, it was found that a surprisingly small (10-25 microM) and brief (<1 ms) local Ca2+ signal is sufficient to achieve the amount, and the kinetics of the physiological transmitter release. The high cooperativity of Ca2+ in inducing vesicle fusion and the non-saturation of the Ca2+-sensor for vesicle fusion renders small changes of the local Ca2+-signal highly effective in changing the release probability; an insight that is important for our understanding of short-term modulation of synaptic strength.},

	Abstract = {Morphological and biochemical studies indicate association between voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and the vesicle docking complex at vertebrate presynaptic active zones, which constrain the separation between some Ca2+ channels and vesicles to 20 nm or less. To address the effect of the precise geometrical relationship among the vesicles, the Ca2+ channel, and the proteins of the release machinery on neurotransmitter release, we developed a Monte Carlo simulation of Ca2+ diffusion and buffering with nanometer resolution. We find that the presence of a vesicle as a diffusion barrier alters the shape of the Ca2+ microdomain of a single Ca2+ channel around the vesicle. This effect is maximal in the vicinity of the vesicle and depends critically on the vesicle's distance from the plasmalemma. Ca2+-sensor(s) for release would be exposed to markedly different [Ca2+], varying by up to 13-fold, depending on their position around the vesicle. As a result, the precise position of Ca2+-sensor(s) with respect to the vesicle and the channel can be critical to determining the release probability.

The subsequent lack of saliva production leads to many functional and quality-of-life problems for affected patients and there is no effective conventional therapy. To address this problem, we developed an in vivo gene therapy strategy involving viral vector-mediated transfer of the aquaporin-1 cDNA to irradiation-damaged glands and successfully tested it in two pre-clinical models (irradiated rats and miniature pigs), as well as demonstrated its safety in a large toxicology and biodistribution study. Thereafter, a clinical research protocol was developed that has received approval from all required authorities in the United States. Patients are currently being enrolled in this study.},

A control Ad vector was without any significant effect on salivary flow. Additionally, after administration of Ad vectors to salivary glands, no significant lasting effects were observed in multiple measured clinical chemistry and hematology values. Taken together, the findings show that localized delivery of AdhAQP1 to IR-damaged salivary glands is useful in transiently increasing salivary secretion in both small and large animal models, without significant general adverse events. Based on these results, we are developing a clinical trial to test if the hAQP1 cDNA transfer strategy will be clinically effective in restoring salivary flow in patients with IR-induced parotid hypofunction.},

The differential equations that describe the reaction cycle were formulated, and the steady-state solutions were obtained by digital computation. Conformity between this description and the experimental data obtained from the literature was explored by automatic searches for the sets of rate constants that yielded statistical best-fits to the experimental data. Fits were obtained from renal epithelial cell lines, HeLa cells, and duck erythrocytes.

	Abstract = {The model proposed by Diamond and Bossert [1] for isotonic water transport has received wide acceptance in recent years. It assumes that the local driving force for water transport is a standing osmotic gradient produced in the lateral intercellular spaces of the epithelial cell layer by active solute transport. While this model is based on work done in absorptive epithelia where the closed to open direction of the lateral space and the direction of net transport are the same, it has been proposed that the lateral spaces could also serve as the site of the local osmotic gradients for water transport in secretory epithelia, where the closed to open direction of the lateral space and net transport are opposed, by actively transporting solute out of the space rather than into it. Operation in the backward direction, however, requires a lower than ambient hydrostatic pressure within the lateral space which would seem more likely to cause the space to collapse with loss of function. On the other hand, most secretory epithelia are characterized by transport into a restricted ductal system which is similar to the lateral intercellular space in the absorptive epithelia in that its closed to open direction is the same as that of net transport. In vitro micropuncture studies on the exocrine pancreas of the rabbit indicate the presence of a small but statistically significant increase in juice osmolality, 6 mOsm/kg H(2)O, at the site of electrolyte and water secretion in the smallest extralobular ducts with secretin stimulation which suggests that the ductal system in the secretory epithelia rather than the lateral intercellular space is the site of the local osmotic gradients responsible for isotonic water transport.},

	Abstract = {At the ultrastructural level, epithelia performing solute-linked water transport possess long, narrow channels open at one end and closed at the other, which may constitute the fluid transport route (e.g., lateral intercellular spaces, basal infoldings, intracellular canaliculi, and brush-border microvilli). Active solute transport into such folded structures would establish standing osmotic gradients, causing a progressive approach to osmotic equilibrium along the channel's length. The behavior of a simple standing-gradient flow system has therefore been analyzed mathematically because of its potential physiological significance. The osmolarity of the fluid emerging from the channel's open end depends upon five parameters: channel length, radius, and water permeability, and solute transport rate and diffusion coefficient. For ranges of values of these parameters encountered experimentally in epithelia, the emergent osmolarity is found by calculation to range from isotonic to a few times isotonic; i.e., the range encountered in epithelial absorbates and secretions. The transported fluid becomes more isotonic as channel radius or solute diffusion coefficient is decreased, or as channel length or water permeability is increased. Given appropriate parameters, a standing-gradient system can yield hypertonic fluids whose osmolarities are virtually independent of transport rate over a wide range, as in distal tubule and avian salt gland. The results suggest that water-to-solute coupling in epithelia is due to the ultrastructural geometry of the transport route.},

	Abstract = {Here we describe a procedure to image subcellular structures in live rodents that is based on the use of confocal intravital microscopy. As a model organ, we use the salivary glands of live mice since they provide several advantages. First, they can be easily exposed to enable access to the optics, and stabilized to facilitate the reduction of the motion artifacts due to heartbeat and respiration. This significantly facilitates imaging and tracking small subcellular structures. Second, most of the cell populations of the salivary glands are accessible from the surface of the organ. This permits the use of confocal microscopy that has a higher spatial resolution than other techniques that have been used for in vivo imaging, such as two-photon microscopy. Finally, salivary glands can be easily manipulated pharmacologically and genetically, thus providing a robust system to investigate biological processes at a molecular level. In this study we focus on a protocol designed to follow the kinetics of the exocytosis of secretory granules in acinar cells and the dynamics of the apical plasma membrane where the secretory granules fuse upon stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors. Specifically, we used a transgenic mouse that co-expresses cytosolic GFP and a membrane-targeted peptide fused with the fluorescent protein tandem-Tomato. However, the procedures that we used to stabilize and image the salivary glands can be extended to other mouse models and coupled to other approaches to label in vivo cellular components, enabling the visualization of various subcellular structures, such as endosomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and the actin cytoskeleton.},

	Abstract = {The primary secretion from exocrine gland cells is a fluid rich in Na+ and Cl- with a plasmalike ionic composition. Activation of specific receptors on the plasma membrane by hormones and neurotransmitters, which leads to activation of the phosphoinositol metabolism, results in release of Ca2+ from internal Ca2+ stores. Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) then rises simultaneously at both the basolateral and luminal parts of the acinar cell, reaching maximum values within 1 s after stimulation. In parotid acinar cells, increased [Ca2+]i activates the opening of maxi K+ channels located on the basolateral membrane and Cl- channels presumably located on the luminal membrane, resulting in rapid loss of K+ and Cl- and water and cell shrinkage. Extracellular electroneutrality is maintained by a paracellular Na+ flux into the lumen. Because of the simultaneous activation of K+ and Cl- channels, secretion occurs at a virtually constant membrane potential of about -60 mV. After maximal muscarinic cholinergic stimulation, loss of K+, Cl-, and water results in an approximate 25% reduction in cell volume within 10-15 s after receptor activation. Concomitant with loss of Cl-, there is a loss of HCO3- from the cell, causing a decrease in intracellular pH of 0.1 pH units because of the carbonic anhydrase-mediated conversion of CO2 into H+ and HCO3-. H+ generated from the metabolism and HCO3- production is compensated for by extrusion of H+ by a Na(+)-H+ exchange mechanism, which is responsible for approximately 75% of net Na+ gain that occurs after stimulation. Increased [Na+]i activates the Na(+)-K+ pump, which in turn extrudes Na+ from the cells. In both the unstimulated and stimulated states, cellular production of HCO3- can drive a net uptake of Cl- via the Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange mechanism operating in parallel with the Na(+)-H+ exchanger. The operation of the Cl(-)-HCO3- exchanger is, together with a Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport system, essential for maintainance of a high [Cl-]i both in the unstimulated state and during Cl- reuptake.},

	Abstract = {Fluid and electrolyte transport is driven by transepithelial Cl- movement. The opening of Cl- channels in the apical membrane of salivary gland acinar cells initiates the fluid secretion process, whereas the activation of Cl- channels in both the apical and the basolateral membranes of ductal cells is thought to be necessary for NaCl re-absorption. Saliva formation can be evoked by sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation. The composition and flow rate vary greatly, depending on the type of stimulation. As many as five classes of Cl- channels with distinct gating mechanisms have been identified in salivary cells. One of these Cl- channels is activated by intracellular Ca2+, while another is gated by cAMP. An increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration is the dominant mechanism triggering fluid secretion from acinar cells, while cAMP may be required for efficient NaCl re-absorption in many ductal cells. In addition to cAMP- and Ca(2+)-gated Cl- channels, agonist-induced changes in membrane potential and cell volume activate different Cl- channels that likely play a role in modulating fluid and electrolyte movement. In this review, the properties of the different types of Cl- currents expressed in salivary gland cells are described, and functions are proposed based on the unique properties of these channels.},

Two receptor pathways exist, one involving cAMP, which primarily regulates enzyme secretion, and another involving the hydrolysis of PIP2, which regulates Ca2+ mobilization and, subsequently, monovalent ion fluxes probably important in ion and water secretion in the intact gland. Mobilization of Ca2+ results from both the release of internal Ca2+, and from Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space. The signal for Ca2+ release appears to be (1,4,5)IP3, one of the water soluble products of PIP2 hydrolysis. The mechanism controlling Ca entry is not understood, but speculation abounds. Hydrolysis of PIP2 also produces DG, which has a messenger role in activating a specific protein kinase, the C kinase. The C kinase interacts with Ca2+ mobilization in some as yet uncharacterized way in regulating enzyme secretion.},

	Abstract = {The criteria for diagnosis of primary Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome continue to be controversial, leading to confusion in clinical practice and in the research literature. Among Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome patients who fulfill the European criteria, only 15% of those would fulfill the San Diego criteria. This difference in disease classification leads to difficulty in evaluating clinical trials and in elucidating pathogenetic mechanisms, because different patient populations are evaluated. As a result of the ease and safety of minor salivary gland biopsy, Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome serves as a prototype model to study the immunopathogenic features of a human organ-specific autoimmune disease. Critical features of pathogenesis include: 1) failure to "delete" autoimmune T cells at the level of thymic selection; 2) "homing" of autoimmune lymphocytes to salivary and lacrimal glands via high endothelial venules; 3) clonal expansion of autoimmune T cells in the glands; 4) upregulation of major histocompatibility antigens and adhesive molecules by epithelial cells in the glands; 5) secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by both lymphocytes and epithelial cells; 6) decreased neural innervation of the glands; 7) failure of residual glandular tissue express secretory functions; and 8) failure to remove autoimmune T cells by normal mechanisms of apoptosis. Each of these steps is regulated by cell-matrix interactions, cytokine and growth factor secretion, cell membrane receptor stimulation, "second" signals in the cytoplasm, and nuclear transcription factors. Recent studies on each of these steps in Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome have suggested their role in pathogenesis and, consequently, their potential as sites for therapeutic intervention.},

	Abstract = {Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by symptoms of oral and ocular dryness and a chronic, progressive loss of salivary and lacrimal function. The exocrine involvement is the result of a focal, peri-ductal mononuclear cell infiltrate and the subsequent loss of secretory epithelial cells. The mechanisms of this autoimmune exocrinopathy are not understood fully. Many recent investigations have described alterations in a number of immune mediators within the salivary glands. These studies provide new insights into the immune regulation of normal salivary gland functions and the mechanisms of gland damage in Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome.},

Xerostomia may be an early symptom of several morbid systemic conditions with important implications for the medical and dental management of patients. Oral dryness also has negative effects on an individual's emotional well-being and quality of life. The complaint of xerostomia necessitates a complete evaluation of a patient's general health, salivary gland function, and oral motor and sensory abilities. The salivary gland assessment includes symptom review, analysis of glandular secretions, scintiscanning, and minor labial gland biopsy. No single component is sufficient to adequately diagnose the presence, extent, or cause of salivary dysfunction. Treatment of a dry mouth, to date, is mainly palliative in nature, with the intent of preserving oral structures and functions. Better therapies are essential in the management of xerostomia, whatever the cause. The importance of xerostomia as a symptom is increasingly recognized in medicine and dentistry. The dentist is commonly the first health professional to hear this complaint and may be critical in directing a full and appropriate evaluation.},

	Abstract = {Secretion from the salivary glands is driven by osmosis following the establishment of osmotic gradients between the lumen, the cell and the interstitium by active ion transport. We consider a dynamic model of osmotically driven primary saliva secretion and use singular perturbation approaches and scaling assumptions to reduce the model. Our analysis shows that isosmotic secretion is the most efficient secretion regime and that this holds for single isolated cells and for multiple cells assembled into an acinus. For typical parameter variations, we rule out any significant synergistic effect on total water secretion of an acinar arrangement of cells about a single shared lumen. Conditions for the attainment of isosmotic secretion are considered, and we derive an expression for how the concentration gradient between the interstitium and the lumen scales with water- and chloride-transport parameters. Aquaporin knockout studies are interpreted in the context of our analysis and further investigated using simulations of transport efficiency with different membrane water permeabilities. We conclude that recent claims that aquaporin knockout studies can be interpreted as evidence against a simple osmotic mechanism are not supported by our work. Many of the results that we obtain are independent of specific transporter details, and our analysis can be easily extended to apply to models that use other proposed ionic mechanisms of saliva secretion.},

	Abstract = {The investigation of near-isosmotic water transport in epithelia goes back over 100 years; however, debates over mechanism and pathway remain. Aquaporin (AQP) knockouts have been used by various research groups to test the hypothesis of an osmotic mechanism as well as to explore the paracellular versus transcellular pathway debate. Nonproportional reductions in the water permeability of a water-transporting epithelial cell (e.g., a reduction of around 80-90 %) compared to the reduction in overall water transport rate in the knockout animal (e.g., a reduction of 50-60 %) are commonly found. This nonproportionality has led to controversy over whether AQP knockout studies support or contradict the osmotic mechanism. Arguments raised for and against an interpretation supporting the osmotic mechanism typically have partially specified, implicit, or incorrect assumptions. We present a simple mathematical model of the osmotic mechanism with clear assumptions and, for models based on this mechanism, establish a baseline prediction of AQP knockout studies. We allow for deviations from isotonic/isosmotic conditions and utilize dimensional analysis to reduce the number of parameters that must be considered independently. This enables a single prediction curve to be used for multiple epithelial systems. We find that a simple, transcellular-only osmotic mechanism sufficiently predicts the results of knockout studies and find criticisms of this mechanism to be overstated. We note, however, that AQP knockout studies do not give sufficient information to definitively rule out an additional paracellular pathway.},

	Abstract = {Plasma insulin is pulsatile and reflects oscillatory insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. Although both islet Ca(2+) and metabolism oscillate, there is disagreement over their interrelationship, and whether they can be dissociated. In some models of islet oscillations, Ca(2+) must oscillate for metabolic oscillations to occur, whereas in others metabolic oscillations can occur without Ca(2+) oscillations. We used NAD(P)H fluorescence to assay oscillatory metabolism in mouse islets stimulated by 11.1 mM glucose. After abolishing Ca(2+) oscillations with 200 microM diazoxide, we observed that oscillations in NAD(P)H persisted in 34% of islets (n = 101). In the remainder of the islets (66%) both Ca(2+) and NAD(P)H oscillations were eliminated by diazoxide. However, in most of these islets NAD(P)H oscillations could be restored and amplified by raising extracellular KCl, which elevated the intracellular Ca(2+) level but did not restore Ca(2+) oscillations. Comparatively, we examined islets from ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel-deficient SUR1(-/-) mice. Again NAD(P)H oscillations were evident even though Ca(2+) and membrane potential oscillations were abolished. These observations are predicted by the dual oscillator model, in which intrinsic metabolic oscillations and Ca(2+) feedback both contribute to the oscillatory islet behavior, but argue against other models that depend on Ca(2+) oscillations for metabolic oscillations to occur.},

@article{Merrins2012,
	Abstract = {Pulses of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells help maintain blood glucose in a narrow range, although the source of these pulses is unclear. It has been proposed that a positive feedback circuit exists within the glycolytic pathway, the autocatalytic activation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), which endows pancreatic beta-cells with the ability to generate oscillations in metabolism. Flux through PFK1 is controlled by the bifunctional enzyme PFK2/FBPase2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) in two ways: via (1) production/degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru2,6-BP), a potent allosteric activator of PFK1, as well as (2) direct activation of glucokinase due to a protein-protein interaction. In this study, we used a combination of live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling to examine the effects of inducibly-expressed PFK2/FBPase2 mutants on glucose-induced Ca(2+) pulsatility in mouse islets. Irrespective of the ability to bind glucokinase, mutants of PFK2/FBPase2 that increased the kinase:phosphatase ratio reduced the period and amplitude of Ca(2+) oscillations. Mutants which reduced the kinase:phosphatase ratio had the opposite effect. These results indicate that the main effect of the bifunctional enzyme on islet pulsatility is due to Fru2,6-BP alteration of the threshold for autocatalytic activation of PFK1 by Fru1,6-BP. Using computational models based on PFK1-generated islet oscillations, we then illustrated how moderate elevation of Fru-2,6-BP can increase the frequency of glycolytic oscillations while reducing their amplitude, with sufficiently high activation resulting in termination of slow oscillations. The concordance we observed between PFK2/FBPase2-induced modulation of islet oscillations and the models of PFK1-driven oscillations furthermore suggests that metabolic oscillations, like those found in yeast and skeletal muscle, are shaped early in glycolysis.},

	Abstract = {The P2X7 receptor is a trimeric channel with three binding sites for ATP, but how the occupancy of these sites affects gating is still not understood. Here we show that naive receptors activated and deactivated monophasically at low and biphasically at higher agonist concentrations. Both phases of response were abolished by application of Az10606120, a P2X7R-specific antagonist. The slow secondary growth of current in the biphasic response coincided temporally with pore dilation. Repetitive stimulation with the same agonist concentration caused sensitization of receptors, which manifested as a progressive increase in the current amplitude, accompanied by a slower deactivation rate. Once a steady level of the secondary current was reached, responses at high agonist concentrations were no longer biphasic but monophasic. Sensitization of receptors was independent of Na(+) and Ca(2+) influx and ∼30 min washout was needed to reestablish the initial gating properties. T15E- and T15K-P2X7 mutants showed increased sensitivity for agonists, responded with monophasic currents at all agonist concentrations, activated immediately with dilated pores, and deactivated slowly. The complex pattern of gating exhibited by wild-type channels can be accounted for by a Markov state model that includes negative cooperativity of agonist binding to unsensitized receptors caused by the occupancy of one or two binding sites, opening of the channel pore to a low conductance state when two sites are bound, and sensitization with pore dilation to a high conductance state when three sites are occupied.},

	Abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated P2X2 receptors exhibit two opposite activation-dependent changes, pore dilation and pore closing (desensitization), through a process that is incompletely understood. To address this issue and to clarify the roles of calcium and the C-terminal domain in gating, we combined biophysical and mathematical approaches using two splice forms of receptors: the full-size form (P2X2aR) and the shorter form missing 69 residues in the C-terminal domain (P2X2bR). Both receptors developed conductivity for N-methyl-D-glucamine within 2-6 s of ATP application. However, pore dilation was accompanied with a decrease rather than an increase in the total conductance, which temporally coincided with rapid and partial desensitization. During sustained agonist application, receptors continued to desensitize in calcium-independent and calcium-dependent modes. Calcium-independent desensitization was more pronounced in P2X2bR, and calcium-dependent desensitization was more pronounced in P2X2aR. In whole cell recording, we also observed use-dependent facilitation of desensitization of both receptors. Such behavior was accounted for by a 16-state Markov kinetic model describing ATP binding/unbinding and activation/desensitization. The model assumes that naive receptors open when two to three ATP molecules bind and undergo calcium-independent desensitization, causing a decrease in the total conductance, or pore dilation, causing a shift in the reversal potential. In calcium-containing media, receptor desensitization is facilitated and the use-dependent desensitization can be modeled by a calcium-dependent toggle switch.

	Abstract = {The ATP-gated P2X7 receptor channel (P2X7R) operates as a cytolytic and apoptotic receptor but also controls sustained cellular responses, including cell growth and proliferation. However, it has not been clarified how the same receptor mediates such opposing effects. To address this question, we have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and mathematical studies using wild-type and mutant rat P2X7Rs. Activation of na{\"\i}ve (not previously stimulated) receptors by low agonist concentrations caused monophasic slow desensitizing currents and internalization of receptors without other changes in the cellular morphology, much like other P2XRs. In contrast, saturating agonist concentrations induced high-amplitude biphasic currents, reflecting pore dilation and causing rapid cell swelling and lysis. The existence of these two signaling patterns was accounted for using a revised Markov-state model that included, in addition to na{\"\i}ve and sensitized states, desensitized states. Occupancy of one or two ATP-binding sites of na{\"\i}ve receptors favored a slow transition to desensitized states, whereas occupancy of the third binding site favored a transition to sensitized/dilated states. Consistent with model predictions, nondilating P2X7R mutants always generated desensitizing currents. These results suggest that the level of saturation of the ligand binding sites determines the nature of the P2X7R gating and cellular actions.},

	Abstract = {A great deal of work has gone into classifying bursting oscillations, periodic alternations of spiking and quiescence modeled by fast-slow systems. In such systems, one or more slow variables carry the fast variables through a sequence of bifurcations that mediate transitions between oscillations and steady states. A rigorous classification approach is to characterize the bifurcations found in the neighborhood of a singularity; a measure of the complexity of the bursting oscillation is then given by the smallest codimension of the singularities near which it occurs. Fold/homoclinic bursting, along with most other burst types of interest, has been shown to occur near a singularity of codimension three by examining bifurcations of a cubic Li{\'e}nard system; hence, these types of bursting have at most codimension three. Modeling and biological considerations suggest that fold/homoclinic bursting should be found near fold/subHopf bursting, a more recently identified burst type whose codimension has not been determined yet. One would expect that fold/subHopf bursting has the same codimension as fold/homoclinic bursting, because models of these two burst types have very similar underlying bifurcation diagrams. However, no codimension-three singularity is known that supports fold/subHopf bursting, which indicates that it may have codimension four. We identify a three-dimensional slice in a partial unfolding of a doubly-degenerate Bodganov-Takens point, and show that this codimension-four singularity gives rise to almost all known types of bursting.},

	Abstract = {In the vertebrate brain excitatory synaptic contacts typically occur on the tiny evaginations of neuron dendritic surface known as dendritic spines. There is clear evidence that spine heads are endowed with voltage-dependent excitable channels and that action potentials invade spines. Computational models are being increasingly used to gain insight into the functional significance of a spine with an excitable membrane. The spike-diffuse-spike (SDS) model is one such model that admits to a relatively straightforward mathematical analysis. In this paper we demonstrate that not only can the SDS model support solitary travelling pulses, already observed numerically in more detailed biophysical models, but that it has periodic travelling wave solutions. The exact mathematical treatment of periodic travelling waves in the SDS model is used, within a kinematic framework, to predict the existence of connections between two periodic spike trains of different interspike interval. The associated wave front in the sequence of interspike intervals travels with a constant velocity without degradation of shape, and might therefore be used for the robust encoding of information.},

	Abstract = {Many cells use oscillations in calcium concentration to transmit messages. The oscillations largely result from an influx of calcium into the cytosol from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by an efflux of calcium from the cytosol back into the ER. The sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump pumps calcium into the ER. It binds calcium on the cytosolic side and releases it on the ER side and in the delay between binding and release, calcium is buffered by the pump. We developed a model of a buffering SERCA pump and investigated whether including this in a model of calcium oscillations has any significant effects. We found that the oscillations produced when using the SERCA pump, which does not buffer calcium, have a larger amplitude and a slightly smaller period than when using the buffering SERCA pump. We show that the buffering SERCA pump shows adaptation to a stimulus, and we demonstrate that, by using a bidirectional SERCA pump, we are able to eliminate futile cycling of calcium between the cytosol and ER when the cell is at rest.},

@article{groff2008,
	Abstract = {Localized intracellular Ca(2+) elevations known as puffs and sparks arise from the cooperative activity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Ca(2+) channels (IP(3)Rs) and ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) channels (RyRs) clustered at Ca(2+) release sites on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum or sarcoplasmic reticulum. When Markov chain models of these intracellular Ca(2+)-regulated Ca(2+) channels are coupled via a mathematical representation of a Ca(2+) microdomain, simulated Ca(2+) release sites may exhibit the phenomenon of "stochastic Ca(2+) excitability" reminiscent of Ca(2+) puffs and sparks where channels open and close in a concerted fashion. To clarify the role of Ca(2+) inactivation of IP(3)Rs and RyRs in the dynamics of puffs and sparks, we formulate and analyze Markov chain models of Ca(2+) release sites composed of 10-40 three-state intracellular Ca(2+) channels that are inactivated as well as activated by Ca(2+). We study how the statistics of simulated puffs and sparks depend on the kinetics and dissociation constant of Ca(2+) inactivation and find that puffs and sparks are often less sensitive to variations in the number of channels at release sites and strength of coupling via local [Ca(2+)] when the average fraction of inactivated channels is significant. Interestingly, we observe that the single channel kinetics of Ca(2+) inactivation influences the thermodynamic entropy production rate of Markov chain models of puffs and sparks. While excessively fast Ca(2+) inactivation can preclude puffs and sparks, moderately fast Ca(2+) inactivation often leads to time-irreversible puffs and sparks whose termination is facilitated by the recruitment of inactivated channels throughout the duration of the puff/spark event. On the other hand, Ca(2+) inactivation may be an important negative feedback mechanism even when its time constant is much greater than the duration of puffs and sparks. In fact, slow Ca(2+) inactivation can lead to release sites with a substantial fraction of inactivated channels that exhibit puffs and sparks that are nearly time-reversible and terminate without additional recruitment of inactivated channels.},

	Abstract = {Oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ can be induced by a variety of cellular signalling processes (Woods et al., 1986; Berridge 1988; Jacob et al., 1988) and appear to play a role in secretion (Stojilkovi{\'c} et al., 1994), fertilization (Miyazaki et al., 1993), and smooth muscle contraction (Iino and Tsukioka, 1994). Recently, great progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms involved in a particular class of Ca2+ oscillation, associated with the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) (Berridge, 1993). Working in concert with intracellular Ca2+, InsP3 controls Ca2+ release via the InsP3 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Berridge and Irvine, 1989). The IP3 receptor is regulated by its coagonists InsP3 and Ca2+, which both activate and inhibit Ca2+ release (Finch et al., 1991; Bezprozvanny et al., 1991; De Young and Keizer, 1992). These processes, together with the periodic activation of Ca2+ uptake into the ER, have been identified as key features in the mechanism of InsP3-induced Ca2+ oscillations in pituitary gonadotrophs (Li et al., 1994), Xenopus laevis oocytes (Lechleiter and Clapham, 1992; Atri et al., 1993), and other cell types (Keizer and De Young, 1993). Earlier discussions and models of InsP3-induced Ca2+ oscillations focused on the nature and number of internal releasable pools of Ca2+ (Goldbeter et al., 1990; Swillens and Mercan, 1990; Somogyi and Stucki, 1991), the importance of oscillations in InsP3 (Meyer and Stryer, 1988), and other issues not based on detailed experimental findings in specific cells types.},

Single-channel patch-clamp recordings are a typical way to study these receptors as well as other ion channels. Methods for analyzing and using this type of data have been developed to fit Markov models of the receptor. The usual method of parameter fitting is based on maximum-likelihood techniques. However, Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are becoming more popular. We describe the application of the Bayesian methods to real experimental single-channel data in three ion channels: the ryanodine receptor, the K(+) channel, and the IPR. One of the main aims of all three studies was that of model selection with different approaches taken. We also discuss the modeling implications for single-channel data that display different levels of channel activity within one recording.},

Based on single-channel data from the type-I inositol trisphosphate receptor, and using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, we show that the most complex time-dependent model that can be unambiguously determined from steady-state data is one with three closed states and one open state, and we determine how the rate constants depend on calcium. Because the transitions between these states are complex functions of calcium concentration, each model state must correspond to a group of physical states. We fit two different topologies and find that both models predict that the main effect of [Ca(2+)] is to modulate the probability that the receptor is in a state that is able to open, rather than to modulate the transition rate to the open state.},

	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) [corrected] binding to its receptors (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates Ca2+ release from the ER lumen to the cytoplasm, generating complex cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration signals including temporal oscillations and propagating waves. IP3-mediated Ca2+ release is also controlled by cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration with both positive and negative feedback. Single-channel properties of the IP3R in its native ER membrane were investigated by patch clamp electrophysiology of isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei to determine the dependencies of IP3R on cytoplasmic Ca2+ and IP3 concentrations under rigorously defined conditions. Instead of the expected narrow bell-shaped cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) response centered at approximately 300 nM-1 microM, the open probability remained elevated (approximately 0.8) in the presence of saturating levels (10 microM) of IP3, even as [Ca2+]i was raised to high concentrations, displaying two distinct types of functional Ca2+ binding sites: activating sites with half-maximal activating [Ca2+]i (Kact) of 210 nM and Hill coefficient (Hact) approximately 2; and inhibitory sites with half-maximal inhibitory [Ca2+]i (Kinh) of 54 microM and Hill coefficient (Hinh) approximately 4. Lowering IP3 concentration was without effect on Ca2+ activation parameters or Hinh, but decreased Kinh with a functional half-maximal activating IP3 concentration (KIP3) of 50 nM and Hill coefficient (HIP3) of 4 for IP3. These results demonstrate that Ca2+ is a true receptor agonist, whereas the sole function of IP3 is to relieve Ca2+ inhibition of IP3R. Allosteric tuning of Ca2+ inhibition by IP3 enables the individual IP3R Ca2+ channel to respond in a graded fashion, which has implications for localized and global cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration signaling and quantal Ca2+ release.},

	Abstract = {Single-channel properties of the Xenopus inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) ion channel were examined by patch clamp electrophysiology of the outer nuclear membrane of isolated oocyte nuclei. With 140 mM K+ as the charge carrier (cytoplasmic [IP3] = 10 microM, free [Ca2+] = 200 nM), the IP3R exhibited four and possibly five conductance states. The conductance of the most-frequently observed state M was 113 pS around 0 mV and approximately 300 pS at 60 mV. The channel was frequently observed with high open probability (mean P(o) = 0.4 at 20 mV). Dwell time distribution analysis revealed at least two kinetic states of M with time constants tau < 5 ms and approximately 20 ms; and at least three closed states with tau approximately 1 ms, approximately 10 ms, and >1 s. Higher cytoplasmic potential increased the relative frequency and tau of the longest closed state. A novel "flicker" kinetic mode was observed, in which the channel alternated rapidly between two new conductance states: F1 and F2. The relative occupation probability of the flicker states exhibited voltage dependence described by a Boltzmann distribution corresponding to 1.33 electron charges moving across the entire electric field during F1 to F2 transitions. Channel run-down or inactivation (tau approximately 30 s) was consistently observed in the continuous presence of IP3 and the absence of change in [Ca2+]. Some (approximately 10%) channel disappearances could be reversed by an increase in voltage before irreversible inactivation. A model for voltage-dependent channel gating is proposed in which one mechanism controls channel opening in both the normal and flicker modes, whereas a separate independent mechanism generates flicker activity and voltage-reversible inactivation. Mapping of functional channels indicates that the IP3R tends to aggregate into microscopic (<1 microm) as well as macroscopic (approximately 10 microm) clusters. Ca2+-independent inactivation of IP3R and channel clustering may contribute to complex [Ca2+] signals in cells.},

	Abstract = {Patch clamp of the outer nuclear membrane of isolated Xenopus oocyte nucleus was used to measure the single-channel properties of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R). The observed channel was activated by IP3, inhibited by heparin, and Ca(2+)-selective, with ion permeabilities PCa:PK:PCl = 8:1:0.05. In symmetric KCl buffer, the channel was ohmic (113 picosiemens in 140 mM KCl) at low channel currents but rectified at higher positive currents. The nuclear IP3R exhibited three conductance substates: a main substate occurring approximately 90% of channel open time, a double substate with twice the main substate conductance and a third substate with half the main substate conductance, which was observed rarely. Channel open probability fluctuated over time and among nuclei. Mean open channel durations of the main and double substates were approximately 5 and 1 ms, respectively. Many channels exhibited periods of closure lasting seconds, and most inactivated permanently within 5 min of IP3 stimulation. These results provide the first characterization of the single-channel properties of the IP3R in its native membrane environment and demonstrate that patch clamp electrophysiology of intact nuclei can be used to directly record currents through the IP3R.},

	Abstract = {Mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a primary mixed glial cell culture induced a wave of increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that was communicated to surrounding cells. Following propagation of the Ca2+ wave, many cells showed asynchronous oscillations in [Ca2+]i. Dantrolene sodium (10 microM) inhibited the increase in [Ca2+]i associated with this Ca2+ wave by 60-80%, and prevented subsequent Ca2+ oscillations. Despite the markedly decreased magnitude of the increase in [Ca2+]i, the rate of propagation and the extent of communication of the Ca2+ wave were similar to those prior to the addition of dantrolene. Thapsigargin (10 nM to 1 microM) induced an initial increase in [Ca2+]i ranging from 100 nM to 500 nM in all cells that was followed by a recovery of [Ca2+]i to near resting levels in most cells. Transient exposure to thapsigargin for 2 min irreversibly blocked communication of Ca2+ wave from the stimulated cell to adjacent cells. Glutamate (50 microM) induced an initial increase in [Ca2+]i in most cells that was followed by sustained oscillations in [Ca2+]i in some cells. Dantrolene (10 microM) inhibited this initial [Ca2+]i increase caused by glutamate by 65-90% and abolished subsequent oscillations. Thapsigargin (10 nM to 1 micron) abolished the response to glutamate in over 99% of cells. These results suggest that while both dantrolene and thapsigargin inhibit intracellular Ca2+ release, only thapsigargin affects the mechanism that mediates intercellular communication of Ca2+ waves. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that inositol trisphosphate (IP3) mediates the propagation of Ca2+ waves whereas Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release amplifies Ca2+ waves and generates subsequent Ca2+ oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Studies of inositol lipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) have elucidated the main regulatory pathways for PLCbeta and PLCgamma but the regulation of PLCdelta isoenzymes still remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that an increase in Ca2+ ion concentration within the physiological range (0.1-10 microM) is sufficient to stimulate PLCdelta1, but not PLCgamma1 and PLCbeta1, to hydrolyse cellular inositol lipids present in permeabilized cells. The activity of PLCdelta1 is further enhanced in the presence of phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PI-TP). Both full activation by Ca2+ ions and stimulation in the presence of PI-TP require an intact PH domain involved in the membrane attachment of PLCdelta1. The physiological implication of this study is that PLCdelta1 could correspond to a previously uncharacterized PLC responsible for Ca2+ ion-stimulated inositol lipid hydrolysis observed in many cellular systems.},

	Abstract = {Computer-assisted modeling of calcium influx through voltage-activated membrane channels predicted that buffer-limited elevation of cytoplasmic free calcium ion concentration occurs within microscopic hemispherical "domains" centered upon the active Ca channels. With increasing depolarization, the number of activated channels, and hence the number of Ca domains, should increase; the single-channel current should, however, decrease, thereby decreasing Ca2+ accumulation in each domain relative to the macroscopic current. Such voltage dependence of the microscopic distribution of Ca2+ may influence relations between total Ca2+ entry and Ca-dependent processes. Ca-mediated inactivation of Ca channels in Aplysia neurons exhibits behavior consistent with the calcium domain hypothesis.},

This work has emphasized the creation of thresholds and switches for cellular decisions. To date, the dynamics of phosphorylation events have been disregarded yet could be equally relevant for cell function. Here, we discuss theoretical predictions about the kinetic functions of multisite phosphorylation in regulatory networks and how these predictions relate to experimental findings. Using DNA replication as an example, we demonstrate that multisite phosphorylations can support coherent origin firing and robustness against rereplication. We suggest that multisite protein modifications provide a molecular mechanism to robustly time cellular events in the cell cycle, the circadian clock and signal transduction.},

@article{pfeiffer1998,
	Abstract = {We have investigated control mechanisms involved in the propagation of agonist-induced Ca2+ waves in isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Using a confocal laser-scanning microscope, we were able to show that maximal stimulation of cells with acetylcholine (ACh, 500 nM) or bombesin (1 nM) caused an initial Ca2+ release of comparable amounts with both agonists at the luminal cell pole. Subsequent Ca2+ spreading to the basolateral membrane was faster with ACh (17.3 +/- 5.4 microns/s) than with bombesin (8.0 +/- 2.2 microns/s). The speed of bombesin-induced Ca2+ waves could be increased up to the speed of ACh- induced Ca2+ waves by inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). Activation of PKC significantly decreased the speed of ACh-induced Ca2+ waves but had only little effect on bombesin-evoked Ca2+ waves. Within 3 s after stimulation, production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] was higher in the presence of ACh compared with bombesin, whereas bombesin induced higher levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) than ACh. These data suggest that the slower propagation speed of bombesin-induced Ca2+ waves is due to higher activation of PKC in the presence of bombesin compared with ACh. The higher increase in bombesin-compared with ACh- induced DAG production is probably due to activation of phospholipase D (PLD). Inhibition of the PLD-dependent DAG production by preincubation with 0.3% butanol led to an acceleration of the bombesin-induced Ca2+ wave. In further experiments, we could show that ruthenium red (100 microM), an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle, also decreased the speed of ACh-induced Ca2+ waves. The effect of ruthenium red was not additive to the effect of PKC activation. From the data, we conclude that, following Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release in the luminal cell pole, secondary Ca2+ release from stores, which are located in series between the luminal and the basal plasma membrane, modifies Ca2+ spreading toward the basolateral cell side by Ca(2+)- induced Ca2+ release. Activation of PKC leads to a reduction in Ca2+ release from these stores and therefore could explain the slower propagation of Ca2+ waves in the presence of bombesin compared with ACh.},

	Abstract = {The present study was aimed at localization of plasma membrane (PMCA) and intracellular (SERCA) Ca2+ pumps and characterizing their role in initiation and propagation of Ca2+ waves. Specific and polarized expression of Ca2+ pumps was observed in all epithelial cells examined. Immunolocalization revealed expression of PMCA in both the basolateral and luminal membranes of all cell types. SERCA2a appeared to be expressed in the luminal pole, whereas SERCA2b was expressed in the basal pole and the nuclear envelope of pancreatic acini. Interestingly, SERCA2b was found in the luminal pole of submandibular salivary gland acinar and duct cells. These cells expressed SERCA3 in the basal pole. To examine the significance of the polarized expression of SERCA and perhaps PMCA pumps in secretory cells, we compared the effect of inhibition of SERCA pumps with thapsigargine and partial Ca2+ release with ionomycin on Ca2+ release evoked by agonists and Ca2+ uptake induced by antagonists. Despite their polarized expression, Ca2+ uptake by SERCA pumps and Ca2+ efflux by PMCA resulted in uniform reduction in [Ca2+]i. Surprisingly, inhibition of the SERCA pumps, but not Ca2+ release by ionomycin, eliminated the distinct initiation sites and propagated Ca2+ waves, leading to a uniform increase in [Ca2+]i. In addition, inhibition of SERCA pumps reduced the rate of Ca2+ release from internal stores. The implication of these findings to rates of Ca2+ diffusion in the cytosol, compartmentalization of Ca2+ signaling complexes, and mechanism of Ca2+ wave propagation are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In polarized epithelial cells [Ca2+]i waves are initiated in discrete regions and propagate through the cytosol. The structural basis for these compartmentalized and coordinated events are not well understood. In the present study we used a combination of [Ca2+]i imaging at high temporal resolution, recording of Ca2+-activated Cl- current, and immunolocalization by confocal microscopy to study the correlation between initiation and propagation of [Ca2+]i waves and localization of Ca2+ release channels in pancreatic acini and submandibular acinar and duct cells. In all cells Ca2+ waves are initiated in the luminal pole and propagate through the cell periphery to the basal pole. All three cell types express the three known inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). Expression of IP3Rs was confined to the area just underneath the luminal and lateral membranes, with no detectable receptors in the basal pole or other regions of the cells. In pancreatic acini and SMG ducts IP3R3 was also found in the nuclear envelope. Expression of ryanodine receptor was detected in submandibular salivary gland cells but not pancreatic acini. Accordingly, cyclic ADP ribose was very effective in mobilizing Ca2+ from internal stores of submandibular salivary gland but not pancreatic acinar cells. Measurement of [Ca2+]i and localization of IP3Rs in the same cells suggests that only a small part of IP3Rs participate in the initiation of the Ca2+ wave, whereas most receptors in the cell periphery probably facilitate the propagation of the Ca2+ wave. The combined results together with our previous studies on this subject lead us to conclude that the internal Ca2+ pool is highly compartmentalized and that compartmentalization is achieved in part by polarized expression of Ca2+ channels.},

We found that at intermediate and high concentrations all agonists evoked [Ca2+]i waves emanating from the secretory pole of the cell. The [Ca2+]i gradients evoked by ACh and SP were often unidirectional whereas CCK-8- and bombesin-elicited [Ca2+]i responses consisting of [Ca2+]i waves were normally followed by a secondary phase with reversed [Ca2+]i gradients. At low agonist concentrations the [Ca2+]i responses appeared diffuse or localized to the granular part of the cells. The lag times to the [Ca2+]i rises were shorter in response to ACh and SP than for other peptides. Thus, we found that agonists induced different spatio- temporal patterns of Ca2+ waves in pancreatic acinar cells of the guinea-pig.

@article{kasai1995,
	Abstract = {Pancreatic acinar cells display stereotypic Ca2+ waves resulting from Ca2+ release from internal stores during stimulation. The Ca2+ waves are initiated at the luminal pole, and, at high agonist concentrations, spread towards the basal pole. Two key mechanisms behind the generation of Ca2+ waves have been identified. First, the Ca2+ waves are composite, mediated by three distinct Ca2+ release mechanisms with a polarized distribution: high-sensitivity inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors at a small trigger zone (T zone) in the secretory granule area, Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release channels in the granular area and low-sensitivity InsP3 receptors in the basal area. Second, InsP3 can readily diffuse in the cytosol, whereas rises in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) can be confined through strong buffering and sequestration of Ca2+. InsP3 is thus used as a long-range messenger to transmit agonist signals to the T zone, and [Ca2+]i rises at the T zone are used as a local switch. These mechanisms enable preferential activation of the T zone, irrespective of localization of stimuli and agonist receptors. The secretion of enzymes and fluid is a direct consequence of [Ca2+]i rises at the T zone. The Ca2+ waves and oscillations probably boost the T zone functions.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ wave initiation and non-propagating Ca2+ spikes occur as a result of localized Ca2+ release from the more sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. Using high spatial and temporal Ca2+ -imaging techniques we have investigated inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (InsP3)-induced local Ca2+ spiking, which occurs at the site of Ca2+ wave initiation in pancreatic acinar cells. The spatial and temporal organization of a single spike suggested discrete hot spots of Ca2+ release. Further analysis of long trains of Ca2+ spikes demonstrated that these hot spots showed regenerative Ca2+ -release events which were consistently active from spike to spike. Regions adjacent to these hot spots also showed regenerative Ca2+ -release events of similar amplitude but with a much lower frequency of occurrence. We conclude that the InsP3- induced non-propagating Ca2+ spikes can be devolved into smaller components of release. Our results are consistent with a model of coordinated activity of pacemaker hot spots of Ca2+ release that recruit and entrain active Ca2+ -release events from surrounding regions.},

Furthermore, the relationship between [Ca2+]i and the apparent rate of [Ca2+]i increase is similar in both regions of the cell.

Applying digital image processing on Fura-2 loaded acini, we observed that Ca2+ increases either simultaneously throughout the acinar configurations or that occasionally, the rise near the lumen can precede the rise near the basal part by 50-100 ms. Measurements on cell suspensions revealed a correlation between changes in [Ca2+]i and changes in the cellular Ins(1,4,5)P3 content, and it is concluded that in the individual cells Ins(1,4,5)P3 is released to the cytosol within the first second after stimulation. Applying a diffusion coefficient for cytoplasmic Ins(1,4,5)P3 of 2.83 x 10(-6) cm2/s (Allbritton et al., 1992, Science, 258, 1812-1815), we have calculated the concentration profile for this messenger in a sphere with a radius of 10 microns where Ins(1,4,5)P3 is released in the center following a monoexponential function with a rate constant of 4 s-1. Assuming that Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentrations of 1 or 5% of the maximum value is able to release Ca2+, we calculated that Ca2+ waves can appear at a rate of 100 or 40 microns/s. The present data are consistent with Ins(1,4,5)P3 being a cellular messenger, that by diffusion, initiates the Ca2+ release from the cellular pools within the first fraction of a second.},

	Abstract = {The stimulation of the pancreatic acinar cells by physiological secretagogues, such as acetycholine (ACh), activates a well-established intracellular signalling pathway, which involves the generation of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Caffeine, which inhibits this agonist-evoked Ca2+ response reversibly and competitively also blocks the Ca2+ signal generated by the non-specific activation of the membrane guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins). Removal of caffeine is associated with an increase of intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) and the spatial and temporal characteristics of this Ca2+ signal are identical to those of the signal generated by the initial agonist stimulation. Caffeine is also a potent non-specific inhibitor of various cellular phosphodiesterases (PDE) and its inhibitory effect can be reproduced by other PDE inhibitors, chemically related (theophylline) or not (papaverine). Various protocols designed to increase the concentration of either of the major intracellular cyclic nucleotides [adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP)] failed to reproduce the full extent of the caffeine inhibition: at maximal agonist concentration (1 microM ACh) increases of either cAMP or cGMP did not affect the Ca2+ signal, whereas at submaximal doses of agonist (0.1-0.3 microM ACh) they induced partial inhibition. Here we show that only the simultaneous increase of the cellular concentrations of both cyclic nucleotides (either simultaneous or sequential) are effective in mimicking the blocking effect of caffeine and other non-specific PDE inhibitors. These data indicate, thus, that, in addition to other independent intracellular effects, cAMP and cGMP can exert a co-ordinated inhibitory effect of the agonist-evoked Ca2+ signal in pancreatic acinar cells.},

	Abstract = {Type I, II, and III inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors are expressed selectively in different cell lines and tissues. We examined whether type I, II, and III InsP3 receptors differ in ligand-binding affinity and whether such differences influence the sensitivity of Ca2+ stores to InsP3. Initially, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, AR4-2J rat pancreatoma cells, and RINm5F rat insulinoma cells were studied because these cells express predominantly (>85%) type I, II, and III receptors, respectively. Immunopurification of receptors from these cell lines and measurement of InsP3 binding revealed that the rank order of affinity for InsP3 was type I > type II > type III (binding sites were half-maximally saturated at 1.5, 2.5, and 22.4 nM InsP3, respectively). Examination of Ca2+ store mobilization in permeabilized cells showed that InsP3 was equipotent in SH-SY5Y and AR4-2J cells but was approximately 5-fold less potent in RINm5F cells. In contrast, Ca2+ uptake and InsP3-independent Ca2+ release were very similar in the three cell types. The binding affinity of InsP3 in permeabilized SH- SY5Y, AR4-2J, and RINm5F cells correlated well with its potency as a Ca2+-mobilizing agent and with binding affinity to immunopurified type I, II, and III receptors. Thus, InsP3 receptor binding affinity seems to influence the potency of InsP3 as a Ca2+-mobilizing agent. Finally, immunopurification of type I, II, and III receptors from rat tissues revealed that the affinity differences seen in receptors purified from cultured cells are paralleled in vivo. In combination, the data from cell lines and rat tissues reveal that type I, II, and III receptors bind InsP3 with Kd values of approximately 1, approximately 2, and approximately 40 nM, respectively, and that the selective expression of a particular receptor type will influence the sensitivity of cellular Ca2+ stores to InsP3.},

	Abstract = {The ability of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to phosphorylate type I, II, and III inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors was examined. The receptors either were immunopurified from cell lines and then phosphorylated with purified PKA or were phosphorylated in intact cells after activating intracellular cAMP formation. The former studies showed that the type I receptor was a good substrate for PKA (0.65 mol Pi incorporated/mol receptor), whereas type II and III receptors were phosphorylated relatively weakly. The latter studies showed that despite these differences, each of the receptors was phosphorylated in intact cells in response to forskolin or activation of neurohormone receptors. Detailed examination of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which express >/=99% type I receptor, revealed that minor increases in cAMP concentration were sufficient to cause maximal phosphorylation. Thus, VIP and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (acting through Gs-coupled pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide-I receptors) were potent stimuli of type I receptor phosphorylation, and remarkably, even slight increases in cAMP concentration induced by carbachol (acting through Gq-coupled muscarinic receptors) or other Ca2+ mobilizing agents were sufficient to cause phosphorylation. Finally, PKA enhanced InsP3-induced Ca2+ mobilization in a range of permeabilized cell types, irrespective of whether the type I, II, or III receptor was predominant. In summary, these data show that all InsP3 receptors are phosphorylated by PKA, albeit with marked differences in stoichiometry. The ability of both Gs- and Gq-coupled cell surface receptors to effect InsP3 receptor phosphorylation by PKA suggests that this process is widespread in mammalian cells and provides multiple routes by which the cAMP signaling pathway can influence Ca2+ mobilization.},

	Abstract = {Streptolysin O-permeable pancreatic acini were used to study the regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-activated Ca2+ channel (IPACC) by agonists and antagonists. Measurements of the apparent affinity for IP3 (KappIP3) showed that the IPACC is dynamically controlled during cell stimulation and inhibition, i.e. agonists decreased and antagonists increased KappIP3. KappIP3 was also independently regulated by thimerosal, Ca2+ content of the stores, the incubation temperature, activation of protein kinases, and inhibition of protein phosphatases, but none of these mechanisms contributed to the regulation by agonists and antagonists. Incubating the cells with low concentration of GTPgammaS or AIF3 reproduced the effect of the agonist on KappIP3. Moreover, low [GTPgammaS] allowed activation of the IPACC by agonists at basal levels of IP3 and markedly impaired channel inactivation by antagonists. Channel sensitization by GTPgammaS also restored the ability of thimerosal to mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores with no change in cellular IP3 levels. The combination of low [GTPgammaS] and thimerosal locked the channel in an open, antagonist- insensitive state. All modulatory effects of GTPgammaS are independent of phospholipase C activation and IP3 production. We propose that the dynamic regulation of the IPACC by a G protein-dependent mechanism can play a major role in triggering and maintaining Ca2+ oscillations at low agonist concentrations when minimal or no changes in IP3 level take place.},

	Abstract = {Imaging [Ca2+]i at high temporal resolution and measuring the properties of Ca2+ signaling in streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized cells were used to study the spacial organization of signaling complexes. Sequential stimulation of single cells within pancreatic acini with several Ca2+-mobilizing agonists revealed an agonist- specific pattern and propagation rate of Ca2+ waves in the same cells, with CCK8 stimulating the fastest and bombesin the slowest waves. More importantly, each agonist initiated the wave in a different region of the same cell. On the other hand, repetitive stimulation with the same agonist induced Ca2+ waves of the same pattern that were initiated from the same region of the cell. The agonist-specific Ca2+ signaling does not appear to be the result of coupling to different G proteins as infusion of an anti-Galphaq antibody into the cells through a patch pipette equally inhibited Ca2+ signaling by all agonists. Further evidence for compartmentalization of signaling complexes was developed in permeabilized cells. The time-dependent loss of Ca2+ signaling due to SLO permeabilization occurred in an agonist-specific manner in the sequence cabachol > bombesin > cholecystokinin. Signaling by all agonists could be completely restored with as low as 2 &mgr; guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS). At this low concentration GTPgammaS recoupled inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and Ca2+ release, rather than enhancing phospholipase C activity. Priming of Ca2+ signaling by GTPgammaS was agonist-specific. Guanosine 5'-O- (thio)diphosphate (GDPbetaS) uncoupled the ability of signaling complexes to release Ca2+ much better than stimulating inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate production. The uncoupling of Ca2+ signaling by GDPbetaS was also agonist-specific. The combined findings of agonist-specific initiation sites of the Ca2+ wave and differential access of guanine nucleotides to signaling complexes suggest spacial compartmentalization of Ca2+ signaling complexes. Each complex must include a receptor, G protein, and phospholipase C that are coupled to a specific portion of the Ca2+ pool.},

	Abstract = {The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase pump (PMCA) is an integral component of the Ca2+ signaling system which participates in signal transduction during agonist stimulated cell activation. To better understand the physiological function of the pump, isoform 1a (PMCA1a) was over- expressed in rat aortic endothelial cells using a stable transfection system under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The cell lines selected after transfection with PMCA1a construct, expressed 3-4-fold increased pump protein which was mostly targeted to the plasma membrane as indicated by immunoperoxidase staining. Ca2+ uptake assays in a membrane preparation indicated a 3-4-fold increase in Ca2+ pumping activity in the transfected cells, and the expressed PMCA1a showed typical dependence on Ca2+ and calmodulin for stimulation of activity. Measurement of [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]out showed that expression of PMCA1a had a profound effect on different aspects of the Ca2+ signal. The peak increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by ATP and/or thapsigargin was lower but the plateau phase was similar in the PMCA1a expressing cells. Accordingly, titration with ionomycin of Ca2+ content of internal stores, measurement of Ca2+ uptake into the thapsigargin- and oxalate-sensitive pool (endoplasmic reticulum) of isolated microsomes, Ca2+ uptake into streptolysin O-permeabilized cells, and analysis of SERCA mRNA and protein, showed that expression and activity of the SERCA pump was down- regulated in cells expressing PMCA1a pump. Expression of PMCA1a also down-regulated expression of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)- activated Ca2+ channel and the rate of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release in permeable cells, without affecting the affinity of the channel for IP3. On the other hand the rate of store depletion-dependent Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx (Ca2+ entry) into PMCA1a expressing cells was increased by about 2.6-fold. These changes prevented estimating the rate of pump-mediated Ca2+ efflux from changes in [Ca2+]i. Measurement of [Ca2+]out showed that the rate of Ca2+ efflux in cells expressing PMCA1a was about 1.45- fold higher than Neo controls, despite the 4-fold increase in the amount of functional pump protein. The overall study points to the flexibility, interdependence, and adaptability of the different components of the Ca2+ signaling systems to regulate the expression and activity of each component and maintain a nearly constant Ca2+ signal.},

	Abstract = {The least understood aspect of the agonist-induced Ca2+ signal is the activation and regulation of the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ influx (CRAC) across the plasma membrane. To explore the possible role of heterotrimeric G proteins in the various regulatory mechanisms of CRAC, continuous renal epithelial cell lines stably expressing alpha 13 and the constitutively active alpha qQ209L were isolated and used to measure CRAC activity by the Mn2+ quench technique. Release of intracellular Ca2+ by agonist stimulation or thapsigargin was required for activation of CRAC in all cells. Although the size of the internal stores was similar in all cells, CRAC was 2-3-fold higher in alpha 13- and alpha qQ209L-expressing cells. However, the channel was differentially regulated in the two cell types. Incubation at low [Ca2+]i, inhibition of the NOS pathway, or inhibition of tyrosine kinase inhibited CRAC activity in alpha 13 but not alpha qQ209L cells. Treatment with okadaic acid prevented inhibition of the channel by low [Ca2+]i and the protein kinase inhibitors in alpha 13 cells. These results suggest that expression of alpha qQ209L dominantly activates CRAC by stabilizing a phosphorylated state, whereas expression of alpha 13 makes CRAC activation completely dependent on phosphorylation by several kinases. G proteins may also modulate CRAC activity independently of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state of the pathway to increase maximal CRAC activity. Furthermore, our results suggest a general mechanism for regulation of CRAC that depends on coupling of receptors to specific G proteins.},

	Abstract = {Oscillations of free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) are known to occur in many cell types during physiological cell signaling. To identify the basis for the oscillations, we measured both [Ca2+]i and extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) to follow the fate of Ca2+ during stimulation of [Ca2+]i oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells. [Ca2+]i oscillations were initiated by either t-butyloxycarbonyl- Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-Tyr-Nle-Asp-2-phenylethyl ester (CCK-J), which mobilized Ca2+ from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-insensitive pool, or low concentration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP), which mobilized Ca2+ from the IP3-sensitive internal pool. Little Ca2+ efflux occurred during the oscillations triggered by CCK-J or CCK-OP in spite of a large average increase in [Ca2+]i. When internal store Ca2+ pumps were inhibited with thapsigargin (Tg) during [Ca2+]i oscillations, a rapid Ca2+ efflux occurred similar to that measured in intensely stimulated, nonoscillatory cells. Tg also stimulated 45Ca efflux from internal pools of cells stimulated with CCK-J or a low concentration of CCK-OP. Hence, a large fraction of the Ca2+ released during each spike is reincorporated by the internal store Ca2+ pumps. Surprisingly, when the increase in [Ca2+]i during stimulation of oscillations was prevented by loading the cells with 1,2-bis(2- aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, a persistent activation of Ca2+ release and Ca2+ efflux occurred. This was reflected as a persistent increase in [Ca2+]o in cells suspended at low [Ca2+]o or persistent efflux of 45Ca from internal stores of cells maintained at high [Ca2+]o. Since agonist-stimulated Ca2+ release evidently remains activated when [Ca2+]i is highly buffered, the primary mechanism determining Ca2+ oscillations must include an inhibition of Ca2+ release by [Ca2+]i. Loading the cells with 1,2-bis(2- aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid had no apparent effect on the levels or kinetics of IP3 formation in agonist-stimulated cells. This suggests that [Ca2+]i regulated the oscillation by inhibition of Ca2+ release independent of its possible effects on cellular levels of IP3.},

	Abstract = {The role of internal stores and plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps in controlling [Ca2+]i during agonist stimulation and their regulation by agonists are not well understood. We report here measurements of intracellular ([Ca2+]i) and extracellular ([Ca2+]o) Ca2+ concentrations in agonist-stimulated pancreatic acini in an effort to directly address these questions. Stimulation of acini suspended in Ca(2+)-free or Ca(2+)-containing medium with Ca2+ mobilizing agonists resulted in a typical transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of internal Ca2+ pumps, inhibited the rate of [Ca2+]i reduction after agonist stimulation by approximately 40%. Under the same conditions, thapsigargin had no effect on the rate of the unidirectional Ca2+ efflux across the plasma membrane as revealed by measurements of [Ca2+]o. These findings suggest that internal Ca2+ pumps actively remove Ca2+ from the cytosol during continued agonist stimulation. The correlation between the reduction in [Ca2+]i and the increase in [Ca2+]o showed that Ca2+ efflux from cells stimulated with agonist and thapsigargin represent Ca2+ efflux across the plasma membrane. Inhibition of cells exposed to agonist and thapsigargin with a specific antagonist sharply reduced the rates of the [Ca2+]i decrease and the accompanied [Ca2+]o increase. Hence, at comparable [Ca2+]i, Ca2+ efflux from stimulated cells was about 3-fold faster than that from resting cells, indicating that agonists directly activate the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. To study the role of [Ca2+]i increase in plasma membrane Ca2+ pump activation the acini were loaded with 1,2-bis- (2-aminophenoxyethane-N,N,N',N')-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), and [Ca2+]o was measured during agonist stimulation. Surprisingly, although BAPTA completely prevented the increase in [Ca2+]i, Ca2+ efflux rate was reduced by only 34%. These findings provide the first evidence for Ca(2+)-independent activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump by Ca2+ mobilizing agonists.},

	Abstract = {Global (all cells in an acinus) and focal (1-2 out of 10-15 cells) stimulation of pancreatic acini with bombesin or t-butyloxycarbonyl- Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-Tyr-Asp-2-phenylethyl ester (CCKJ) together with modulation of gap junction (GJ) permeability by octanol and NO2- was used to study the role of GJ permeability in controlling [Ca2+]i oscillations and enzyme secretion. GJ permeability was quantitated by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Octanol at 0.5 mM markedly reduced, whereas 15 mM NO2- increased GJ permeability. Focal application of bombesin caused synchronized oscillations in the entire acinus, whereas global stimulation resulted in asynchronous oscillations. Increasing GJ permeability with NO2- had no effect on bombesin-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations. Octanol inhibited ongoing oscillations evoked by focal or global bombesin stimulation. However, when GJ were blocked prior to stimulation, subsequent global stimulation with bombesin induced long-lasting oscillations in all cells. Re-establishing GJ communication for as little as 37.5 s conferred GJ dependence on the order and time of [Ca2+]i spiking evoked by global bombesin stimulation. Focal and global stimulation with CCKJ gave different patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillations. However, in contrast to bombesin, inhibition of GJ with octanol had no effect on oscillations induced by global CCKJ stimulation. Increasing GJ permeability with NO2- synchronized CCKJ-stimulated oscillations by equalizing the amplitude and increasing the frequency in all cells within an acinus. These observations suggest that amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations can be regulated independently of each other, and that GJ permeable molecules modulate the frequency of [Ca2]i oscillation in an agonist-specific manner. Regardless of the agonist, increasing the frequency of oscillations by modulation of GJ permeability correlated with an increased enzyme secretion.},

	Abstract = {The role of [Ca2+]i as a second messenger in non-excitable cells has been appreciated for almost 3 decades. The advent of fluorescent Ca2+ indicators has allowed the monitoring of Ca2+ signalling in suspensions of these cells. Agonist mediated changes in [Ca2+]i usually show an initial Ca2+ transient followed by a maintained increase. The former has been shown to be due to Ca2+ release from one or more intracellular stores, the latter due to activation of receptor operated Ca2+ entry (ROCE). More recently it has been recognized that many cells show distinct maintained oscillatory behavior when examined by single cell optical methods. It is proposed here that these oscillations are the consequence of IP3 and Ca2+ stimulation of Ca2+ release and ligand activation of ROCE followed by Ca2+ inhibition of Ca2+ and ROCE as Ca2+ pumps are activated. These oscillations allow more exact regulation of a pump/leak controlled second messenger such as [Ca2+]i.},

Pancreatic beta cells express the gap junction protein connexin43 and are functionally coupled, making gap junctional communication a likely mechanism for the synchronization of calcium transients among islet cells. To define the mechanism by which pancreatic islet cells coordinate calcium responses, we studied mechanically-induced intercellular calcium waves in the communication- deficient rat insulinoma cell line RINm5f, and in RINm5f cells transfected with the gap junction protein connexin43. Both RINm5f and RINm5f cells transfected with connexin43 propagated calcium waves that required release of calcium from intracellular stores, did not involve gap junctional communication, and appeared to be mediated by autocrine activity of secreted ATP acting on P2U purinergic receptors. Connexin43 transfectants also propagated calcium waves that required gap junctional communication and influx of extracellular calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Gap junction-dependent intercellular calcium waves were inhibited by preventing plasma membrane depolarization. These studies demonstrate two distinct pathways by which insulin-secreting cells can coordinate cytosolic calcium rises, and show that it is by ionic traffic that gap junctions synchronize calcium-dependent events in these cells.},

	Abstract = {Many cells coordinate their activities by transmitting rises in intracellular calcium from cell to cell. In nonexcitable cells, there are currently two models for intercellular calcium wave propagation, both of which involve release of inositol trisphosphate (IP3)- sensitive intracellular calcium stores. In one model, IP3 traverses gap junctions and initiates the release of intracellular calcium stores in neighboring cells. Alternatively, calcium waves may be mediated not by gap junctional communication, but rather by autocrine activity of secreted ATP on P2 purinergic receptors. We studied mechanically induced calcium waves in two rat osteosarcoma cell lines that differ in the gap junction proteins they express, in their ability to pass microinjected dye from cell to cell, and in their expression of P2Y2 (P2U) purinergic receptors. ROS 17/2.8 cells, which express the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43), are well dye coupled, and lack P2U receptors, transmitted slow gap junction-dependent calcium waves that did not require release of intracellular calcium stores. UMR 106-01 cells predominantly express the gap junction protein connexin 45 (Cx45), are poorly dye coupled, and express P2U receptors; they propagated fast calcium waves that required release of intracellular calcium stores and activation of P2U purinergic receptors, but not gap junctional communication. ROS/P2U transfectants and UMR/Cx43 transfectants expressed both types of calcium waves. Gap junction- independent, ATP-dependent intercellular calcium waves were also seen in hamster tracheal epithelia cells. These studies demonstrate that activation of P2U purinergic receptors can propagate intercellular calcium, and describe a novel Cx43-dependent mechanism for calcium wave propagation that does not require release of intracellular calcium stores by IP3. These studies suggest that gap junction communication mediated by either Cx43 or Cx45 does not allow passage of IP3 well enough to elicit release of intracellular calcium stores in neighboring cells.},

	Abstract = {We have characterized the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+- ATPase (SERCA) pumps in cultured rat cortical type-1 astrocytes, type-2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Perfusion with 10 microM cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) or 1 microM thapsigargin evoked a large and persistent elevation in cytosolic [Ca2+] in normal Ca2+-containing medium and a small and transient increase in nominally Ca2+-free medium. Subtraction of the response in Ca2+-free medium from that in the control revealed a slow-onset Ca2+-entry response to SERCA inhibition, which began after most of the store depletion had occurred. Thapsigargin- and CPA-induced responses propagated as Ca2+ waves, which began in several distinct cellular sites and travelled throughout the cell and through nearby cells, in confluent cultures. Propagation was supported by specialized Ca2+-release sites where the amplitude of the response was significantly higher and the rate of rise steeper. Such higher Ca2+- release kinetics were observed at these sites during Ins(1,4,5)P3- mediated Ca2+ waves in the same cells. Fluorescently tagged thapsigargin labelled SERCA pumps throughout glial cell bodies and processes. In oligodendrocyte processes, multiple domains with elevated SERCA staining were always associated with mitochondria. Our results are consistent with a model in which only a single Ca2+ store, expressing Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors and SERCAs sensitive to both thapsigargin and CPA, is present in rat cortical glia, and indicate that inhibition of SERCA activates both Ca2+ release as a wavefront and Ca2+ entry via store-operated channels. The spatial relationship between SERCAs and mitochondria is likely to be important for regulating microdomains of elevated Ca2+-release kinetics.},

	Abstract = {The effects of different adrenoceptor agonists were investigated on mechanically induced Ca2+ waves in astroglial cells in astroglial- neuronal mixed cultures from rat hippocampus. In the initial part of the study some properties of the waves were characterized. The results show that the initiation of the Ca2+ waves was not critically dependent on extracellular Ca2+ but both the calcium signal and the propagation area of the calcium wave were significantly reduced when the experiments were performed in Ca2+-free buffer. In addition, using the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 (1 &mgr;M) and the gap junction uncoupler octanol (1 mM), the results showed that the Ca2+ wave propagation required PLC activation and functional gap junctions. Further, the data also showed that the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA 150 nM) reduced the spreading of the waves. The adrenoceptor agonists isoproterenol (iso; beta), phenylephrine (phe; alpha1) and clonidine (clon; alpha2) were evaluated for their short-term (30 s) effects on the wave propagation. The propagation area was persistently decreased 1, 3 and 5 min after removal of phe. No effects were observed after incubation with iso or clon. Furthermore, using U-73122 or PMA together with phe, shortly incubated, the experiments showed that PLC was a central regulator in the initial phase of the initiation procedure of wave propagation. However, under these conditions PKC was shown not to be involved. Instead it appeared that PKC exerted its inhibitory action on the Ca2+ waves in a latter phase, after prolonged phe exposure. Taken together, the results show that the propagation of Ca2+ waves between astroglial cells in primary cultures can be inhibited/regulated in two principally different ways which involve a pronounced time component. The results also further point out the adrenergic signaling system as an important mediator of dynamic neuron-astroglial information exchange. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Paracrine stimulation and cell-to-cell coupling through gap junctions induce the formation of complex cellular networks that favour the intercellular exchange of nutrients and second messengers. Heterologous intercellular communication was studied in co-cultures of articular chondrocytes and HIG-82 synovial cells by measuring mechanically induced cytosolic changes in Ca2+ ion levels by digital fluorescence video imaging. In confluent co-cultures, mechanical stimulation induced intercellular Ca2+ waves that propagated to both cell types with similar kinetics. Intercellular wave spreading was inhibited by 18alpha- glycyrrhetinic acid and by treatments inhibiting the activation of purinoreceptors, suggesting that intercellular signalling between these two cell types occurs both through gap junctions and ATP-mediated paracrine stimulation.

	Abstract = {In excitable cells, intracellular Ca2+ is released via the ryanodine receptor from the intracellular Ca2+ storing structure, the sarcoplasmic reticulum. To determine whether this released Ca2+ propagates through gap junctions to neighboring cells and thereby constitutes a long range signaling network, we developed a cell system in which cells expressing both connexin-43 and ryanodine receptor are surrounded by cells expressing only connexin-43. When the ryanodine receptor in cells was activated by caffeine, propagation of Ca2+ from these caffeine-responsive cells to neighboring cells was observed with a Ca2+ imaging system using fura-2/AM. Inhibitors of gap junctional communication rapidly and reversibly abolished this propagation of Ca2+. Together with the electrophysiological analysis of transfected cells, the observed intercellular Ca2+ wave was revealed to be due to the reconstituted gap junction of transfected cells. We next evaluated the functional roles of cysteine residues in the extracellular loops of connexin-43 in gap junctional communication. Mutations of Cys54, Cys187, Cys192, and Cys198 to Ser showed the failure of Ca2+ propagation to neighboring cells in accordance with the electrical uncoupling between transfected cells, whereas mutations of Cys61 and Cys68 to Ser showed the same pattern as the wild type. [14C]Iodoacetamide labeling of free thiols of cysteine residues in mutant connexin-43s showed that two pairs of intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed between Cys54 and Cys192 and between Cys187 and Cys198. These results suggest that intercellular Ca2+ signaling takes place in cultured cells expressing connexin-43, leading to their own synchronization and that the extracellular disulfide bonds of connexin- 43 are crucial for this process.},

	Abstract = {Intercellular Ca2+ signalling in primary cultures of articular chondrocytes was investigated with digital fluorescence video imaging. Mechanical stimulation of a single cell induced a wave of increased Ca2+ that was communicated to surrounding cells. Intercellular Ca2+ spreading was inhibited by 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, demonstrating the involvement of gap junctions in signal propagation. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ mechanical stimulation failed to induce Ca2+ responses and communicated Ca2+ waves. Under these conditions Ca2+ microinjection induced intercellular waves involving the cells immediately surrounding the stimulated one. Mechanical stress induced Ca2+ influx in the stimulated, but not in the adjacent cells, as assessed by the Mn2+ quenching technique. Cell treatment with thapsigargin failed to block mechanically induced signal propagation, but significantly reduced the number of cells involved in the communicated Ca2+ wave. Similar results were obtained with the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, which is known to prevent InsP3 generation. These results provide evidence that mechanical stimulation induces a cytosolic Ca2+ increase that may permeate gap junctions, thus acting as an intercellular messenger mediating cell-to-cell communication in articular chondrocytes.},

	Abstract = {The following two processes related to astrocytes are thought to depend on intercellular coupling through gap junctions: the spatial buffering of K+o and the spread of calcium waves in the astrocytic syncytium. We have used the following two independent methods to measure the open state of gap junctions: injection of lucifer yellow, and optical calcium imaging of calcium waves in response to probing the cells with a micropipette. The spread of lucifer yellow and calcium waves was inhibited if the cells were treated with either phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate (PMA) or a synthetic diacylglycerol that activates protein kinase C. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by a 24-h treatment with PMA inhibited the uncoupling effect of PMA, supporting a direct involvement of protein kinase C in the regulation of astroglial gap junctions. Purinergic P2Y receptors, which are coupled to the inositol phospholipid pathway, are expressed by most astroglia in culture. Activation of the P2Y purinergic receptor with the selective agonist 2- methylthio-ATP uncoupled astroglia in a manner similar to the effect of treatment with PMA. Modulation of gap junctional conductance could isolate specific pathways within the astrocytic syncytium to form an extraneuronal information transfer network in brain.},

	Abstract = {Complex patterns of intercellular calcium signaling occur in the CA1 and CA2 regions of hippocampal slice organotypic cultures from neonatal mice. Spontaneous localized intercellular Ca2+ waves involving 5-15 cells propagate concentrically from multiple foci in the stratum oriens and s. radiatum. In these same regions, extensive Ca2+ waves involving hundreds of cells propagate as curvilinear and spiral wavefronts across broad areas of CA1 and CA2. Ca2+ waves travel at rates of 5-10 mu m/s, are abolished by thapsigargin, and do not require extracellular Ca2+. Staining for astrocytes and neurons indicates that these intercellular waves occur primarily in astrocytes. The frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ waves increase in response to bath application of N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) and decrease in response to removal of extracellular Ca2+ or application of tetrodotoxin. This novel pattern of intercellular Ca2+ signaling is characteristic of the behavior of an excitable medium. Networks of glial cells in the hippocampus may behave as an excitable medium whose spatial and temporal signaling properties are modulated by neuronal activity.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms involved in the initiation and the propagation of intercellular calcium signaling (calcium waves) were studied in cultured rat astrocytes. The analysis of calcium waves, induced either by mechanical stimulation or by focal application of ionomycin, indicated that initiation was dependent on the presence of external calcium. In addition, pharmacological experiments indicate that intercellular propagation required PLC activation, integrity of IP3- sensitive internal calcium stores, and functional gap junctions. An extracellular action of ATP or glutamate and participation of voltage- dependent Ca2+ channels were tested by using enzymatic degradation, receptor antagonists, and channel blockers, respectively. Because neither the speed of propagation nor the extent of the calcium waves was affected by these treatments, these alternate mechanisms were excluded from playing a role in intercellular calcium signaling. Biochemical assays and focal applications of several agonists (methoxamine, carbachol, glutamate) of membrane receptors to neurotransmitters and peptides (endothelin 1) demonstrated that their ability to trigger regenerative calcium waves depended on phospholipase C activity and inositol phosphate production. Thus, in rat astrocytes, initiation and propagation of calcium waves involve a sequence of intra- and intercellular steps in which phospholipase C, inositol trisphosphate, internal calcium stores, and gap junction channels play a critical role. The identification of these different events allows us to determine several targets at which the level of long-range signaling in astrocytes may be controlled.},

	Abstract = {Colliding spherical calcium waves in enzymatically isolated rat cardiac myocytes develop new wavefronts propagating perpendicular to the original direction. When investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 AM, "cusp"-like structures become visible that are favorably approximated by double parabolae. The time-dependent position of the vertices is used to determine propagation velocity and negative curvature of the wavefront in the region of collision. It is evident that negatively curved waves propagate faster than positively curved, single waves. Considering two perfectly equal expanding circular waves, we demonstrated that the collision of calcium waves is due to an autocatalytic process (calcium-induced calcium release), and not to a simple phenomenon of interference. Following the spatiotemporal organization in simpler chemical systems maintained under conditions far from the thermodynamic equilibrium (Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction), the dependence of the normal velocity on the curvature of the spreading wavefront is given by a linear relation. The so-called velocity-curvature relationship makes clear that the velocity is enhanced by curvature toward the direction of forward propagation and decreased by curvature away from the direction of forward propagation (with an influence of the diffusion coefficient). Experimentally obtained velocity data of both negatively and positively curved calcium waves were approximated by orthogonal weighted regression. The negative slope of the straight line resulted in an effective diffusion coefficient of 1.2 x 10(-4) mm2/s. From the so-called critical radius, which must be exceeded to initiate a traveling calcium wave, a critical volume (with enhanced [Ca2+]i) of approximately 12 microm3 was calculated. This is almost identical to the volume that is occupied by a single calcium spark.},

A sister clone of the GT1 line, GT1-7 neurons, showed no intercellular Ca2+ waves and were found to have a significantly lower level of connexin26 mRNA than the GT1-1 line.

METHODS: The computer model assumed two known mechanisms of intercellular communication: action potential propagation and calcium wave propagation. Simulations were performed on a desktop computer using available programming language. Model validity was assessed by fitting the computer-simulated contraction to a real contraction and comparing the fit values with values measured independently. RESULTS: The simulated contraction demonstrated five characteristics that are also observed in human labor: 1) gradual onset, 2) a linear rising segment, 3) a plateau region, 4) a symmetrical fall, and 5) gradual offset. The fit values agreed well with values determined experimentally and supported the model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the model, strongly suggesting that intercellular communication occurs throughout the uterus by action potentials and locally within the tissue by calcium waves.},

With increasing activator concentration, the mean distance of propagation increases. Above a critical level of activator, the wave becomes stable.

Using a low affinity ratiometric Ca2+ indicator dye, benzothiazole coumarin (BTC), we found that high concentrations of agonists transiently increased Ca2+ concentrations to the micromolar range (>10 microM) in the trigger zone. Comparison with results obtained with a high affinity Ca2+ indicator dye, fura-2, indicated that fura-2 was in fact saturated with Ca2+ during the agonist-induced Ca2+ spikes in the trigger zone. We further revealed that the micromolar Ca2+ spikes were necessary for inducing exocytosis of zymogen granules investigated using capacitance measurements. In contrast, submicromolar Ca2+ spikes selectively gave rise to sequential activation of luminal and basal ion channels. These results suggest new functional diversity in Ca2+ spikes and a critical role for the micromolar Ca2+ spikes in exocytotic secretion from exocrine acinar cells. Our data also emphasize the value of investigating the Ca2+ signalling using low affinity Ca2+ indicators.},

	Abstract = {We present a theoretical analysis of intracellular calcium waves propagated by calcium feedback at the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor. The model includes essential features of calcium excitability, but is still analytically tractable. Formulas are derived for the wave speed, amplitude, and width. The calculations take into account cytoplasmic Ca buffering, the punctate nature of the Ca release channels, channel inactivation, and Ca pumping. For relatively fast buffers, the wave speed is well approximated by V(infinity) = (J(eff)D(eff)/C0)1/2, where J(eff) is an effective, buffered source strength; D(eff) is the effective, buffered diffusion constant of Ca; and C(0) is the Ca threshold for channel activation. It is found that the saturability and finite on-rate of buffers must be taken into account to accurately derive the wave speed and front width. The time scale governing Ca wave propagation is T(r), the time for Ca release to reach threshold to activate further release. Because IP3 receptor inactivation is slow on this time scale, channel inactivation does not affect the wave speed. However, inactivation competes with Ca removal to limit wave height and front length, and for biological parameter ranges, it is inactivation that determines these parameters. Channel discreteness introduces only small corrections to wave speed relative to a model in which Ca is released uniformly from the surface of the stores. These calculations successfully predict experimental results from basic channel and cell parameters and explain the slowing of waves by exogenous buffers.},

Second messengers were microinjected into a single cell in a monolayer of sheep lens cells while monitoring cytosolic Ca2+ with fura-2 and fluorescence microscopy. All three compounds initiated intercellular Ca2+ waves, but more cells responded following the injection of either IP3 or cADPR than responded following the injection of Ca2+. When either IP3 or cADPR was co-injected with the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, cytosolic Ca2+ in the injected cell decreased but cytosolic Ca2+ in the adjacent cells increased, indicating that the intercellular messenger was IP3 or cADPR, rather than Ca2+. The phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 eliminated mechanically initiated intercellular Ca2+ waves, indicating that mechanical initiation probably requires IP3 production. In U73122- treated cells, injected IP3 initiated an intercellular Ca2+ wave in which the number of cells responding increased as the amount of IP3 injected increased, indicating that the distance traveled by the Ca2+ wave was dependent on cell-to-cell diffusion of IP3. In contrast, the ability of cADPR both to increase cytosolic Ca2+ in the injected cell and to initiate intercellular Ca2+ waves was greatly attenuated by U73122. In conclusion, Ca2+, IP3 and cADPR can all mediate intercellular Ca2+ waves by passing through gap junction channels, but both IP3 and cADPR are more effective intercellular messengers than Ca2+.},

	Abstract = {Because hepatocytes communicate via gap junctions, it has been proposed that Ca2+ waves propagate through this pathway and in the process activate Ca2+-dependent cellular responses. We testedthis hypothesis by measuring vasopressin-induced glycogenolysis in short-term cultures of rat hepatocytes. A 15-min vasopressin (10(-8) M) stimulation induced a reduction of glycogen content that reached a maximum 1-3 h later. Gap junction blockers, octanol or 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, reduced the effect by 70%. The glycogenolytic response induced by Ca2+ ionophore 8- bromo-A-21387, which acts on each hepatocyte, was not affected by gap junction blockers. Moreover, the vasopressin-induced glycogenolysis was lower (70%) in dispersed than in reaggregated hepatocytes and in dispersed hepatocytes was not affected by gap junction blockers. In hepatocytes reaggregated in the presence of a synthetic peptide homologous to a domain of the extracellular loop 1 of the main hepatocyte gap junctional protein, vasopressin-induced glycogenolysis and incidence of dye coupling were drastically reduced. Moreover, gap junctional communication was detected between reaggregated cells, suggesting that hepatocytes with different vasopressin receptor densities become coupled to each other. The vasopressin-induced effect was not affected by suramin, ruling out ATP as a paracrine mediator. We propose that gap junctions allow for a coordinated vasopressin-induced glycogenolytic response despite the heterogeneity among hepatocytes.},

The scanning was conducted at a video rate of 30 frames per second, and the confocal effects included both X and Y planes. Calcium waves were frequently interrupted by calcium transients from either external electro-stimulation pulses or spontaneous sinus rhythm. Our findings suggest that abnormal calcium waves in minute areas cannot disturb the excitation-contraction coupling in the whole heart if the myocardial cells have orderly end-on-end intercellular electric paths.},

	Abstract = {Long range (a few centimeters), long lived (many seconds), spiral chemical waves of calcium ions (Ca2+) are observed in cultured networks of glial cells for normal concentrations of the neurotransmitter kainate. A new method for quantitatively measuring the spatiotemporal size of the waves is described. This measure results in a power law distribution of wave sizes, meaning that the process that creates the waves has no preferred spatial or temporal (size or lifetime) scale. This power law is one signature of self-organized critical phenomena, a class of behaviors found in many areas of science. The physiological results for glial networks are fully supported by numerical simulations of a simple network of noisy, communicating threshold elements. By contrast, waves observed in astrocytes cultured from human epileptic foci exhibited radically different behavior. The background random activity, or "noise", of the network is controlled by the kainate concentration. The mean rate of wave nucleation is mediated by the network noise. However, the power law distribution is invariant, within our experimental precision, over the range of noise intensities tested. These observations indicate that spatially and temporally coherent Ca2+ waves, mediated by network noise may play and important role in generating correlated neural activity (waves) over long distances and times in the healthy vertebrate central nervous system.},

	Abstract = {During brain development, endogenously generated coordinated neuronal activity regulates the precision of developing synaptic circuits (Shatz and Stryker, 1988; Weliky and Katz, 1997). In the neonatal neocortex, a form of endogenous coordinated activity is present as locally restricted intercellular calcium waves that are mediated by gap junctions (Yuste et al., 1992). As in other neuronal and non-neuronal systems, these coordinated calcium fluctuations may form the basis of functional cell assemblies (for review, seeWarner, 1992; Peinado et al., 1993b). In the present study, we investigated the cellular mechanisms that mediate the activation of neuronal domains and the propagation of intercellular calcium waves in slices from neonatal rat neocortex. The occurrence of neuronal domains did not depend on intercellular propagation of regenerative electrical signals because domains persisted after blockade of sodium and calcium-dependent action potentials. Neuronal domains were elicited by intracellular infusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) but not of calcium, indicating the involvement of IP3-related second-messenger systems. Pharmacological stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are linked to the production of IP3, elicited similarly coordinated calcium increases, whereas pharmacological blockade of metabotropic glutamate receptors dramatically reduced the number of neuronal domains. Therefore, the propagating cellular signal that causes the occurrence of neuronal domains seems to be inositol trisphosphate but not calcium. Because coordination of neuronal calcium changes by gap junctions is independent of electrical signals, the function of gap junctions between neocortical neurons is probably to synchronize biochemical rather than electrical activity.},

	Abstract = {Mechanically scratching cell monolayers relieves contact inhibition and induces surviving cells near the wound edge to move and proliferate. The present work was designed to test whether surviving cells passively respond to newly available space, or whether cells are actively stimulated by signals from injured cells nearby. We monitored intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) while scratching confluent monolayers of bovine pulmonary endothelial cells and mouse mammary epithelial cells. Within seconds after wounding, a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i was observed in surviving cells. In endothelial cells, the [Ca2+]i elevation propagated into the monolayer for a distance of 10 to 12 cell rows at a speed of 20 to 28 microm/second. The amplitude of the wave of [Ca2+]i was reduced as it propagated into the monolayer, but the velocity of the wave was nearly constant. Cells that experienced the [Ca2+]i elevation had intact plasma membranes, and survived for over 24 hours post wounding. Removing extracellular Ca2+ decreased the amplitude by two-thirds and reduced the propagation rate by half, suggesting that Ca2+ influx contributed to the increased [Ca2+]i. To determine how [Ca2+]i waves were stimulated, we blocked extracellular communication by fluid perfusion or intercellular communication by breaks in the monolayer. In bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cultures, the [Ca2+]i wave passed over breaks in the monolayer, and was prevented from traveling upstream in a perfusion chamber. Conditioned media from injured cells also elevated [Ca2+]i in unwounded reporter cultures. In mouse mammary epithelial monolayers with established cell- cell contacts, the [Ca2+]i wave passed over breaks in the monolayer, but was only partially prevented from traveling upstream during perfusion. These experiments showed that mechanical wounds lead to long distance, [Ca2+]i-dependent communication between the injured cells and the surviving cell monolayer through at least two mechanisms: first, extracellular release of a chemical stimulus from wounded cells that diffused to neighboring cells (present in both monolayers); second, transmission of an intercellular signal through cell-cell junctions (present in the mammary epithelial monolayers). Thus, mechanical injury provided a direct, chemical stimulus to nearby cells which have not themselves been damaged.},

	Abstract = {Anandamide, an endogenous arachidonic acid derivative that is released from neurons and activates cannabinoid receptors, may act as a transcellular cannabimimetic messenger in the central nervous system. The biological actions of anandamide and the identity of its target cells are, however, still poorly documented. Here we show that anandamide is a potent inhibitor of gap-junction conductance and dye permeability in striatal astrocytes. This inhibitory effect is specific for anandamide as compared to co-released congeners or structural analogues, is sensitive to pertussis toxin and to protein-alkylating agents, and is neither mimicked by cannabinoid-receptor agonists nor prevented by a cannabinoid-receptor antagonist. Glutamate released from neurons evokes calcium waves in astrocytes that propagate via gap junctions, and may, in turn, activate neurons distant from their initiation sites in astrocytes. We find that anandamide blocks the propagation of astrocyte calcium waves generated by either mechanical stimulation or local glutamate application. Thus, by regulating gap- junction permeability, anandamide may control intercellular communication in astrocytes and therefore neuron-glial interactions.},

	Abstract = {Glial cells respond to various electrical, mechanical, and chemical stimuli, including neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones, with an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The increases exhibit a variety of temporal and spatial patterns. These [Ca2+]i responses result from the coordinated activity of a number of molecular cascades responsible for Ca2+ movement into or out of the cytoplasm either by way of the extracellular space or intracellular stores. Transplasmalemmal Ca2+ movements may be controlled by several types of voltage- and ligand-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channels as well as Ca2+ pumps and a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In addition, glial cells express various metabotropic receptors coupled to intracellular Ca2+ stores through the intracellular messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. The interplay of different molecular cascades enables the development of agonist-specific patterns of Ca2+ responses. Such agonist specificity may provide a means for intracellular and intercellular information coding. Calcium signals can traverse gap junctions between glial cells without decrement. These waves can serve as a substrate for integration of glial activity. By controlling gap junction conductance, Ca2+ waves may define the limits of functional glial networks. Neuronal activity can trigger [Ca2+]i signals in apposed glial cells, and moreover, there is some evidence that glial [Ca2+]i waves can affect neurons. Glial Ca2+ signaling can be regarded as a form of glial excitability.},

	Abstract = {The impact of calcium buffering on the initiation and propagation of mechanically elicited intercellular Ca2+ waves was studied using astrocytes loaded with different exogenous, cell membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelators and a laser scanning confocal or video fluorescence microscope. Using an ELISA with a novel antibody to BAPTA, we showed that different cell-permeant chelators, when applied at the same concentrations, accumulate to the same degree inside the cells. Loading cultures with BAPTA, a high Ca2+ affinity chelator, almost completely blocked calcium wave occurrence. Chelators having lower Ca2+ affinities had lesser affects, as shown in their attenuation of both the radius of spread and propagation velocity of the Ca2+ wave. The chelators blocked the process of wave propagation, not initiation, because large [Ca2+]i increases elicited in the mechanically stimulated cell were insufficient to trigger the wave in the presence of high Ca2+ affinity buffers. Wave attenuation was a function of cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering capacity; i.e., loading increasing concentrations of low Ca2+ affinity buffers mimicked the effects of lesser quantities of high-affinity chelators. In chelator-treated astrocytes, changes in calcium wave properties were independent of the Ca2+-binding rate constants of the chelators, of chelation of other ions such as Zn2+, and of effects on gap junction function. Slowing of the wave could be completely accounted for by the slowing of Ca2+ ion diffusion within the cytoplasm of individual astrocytes. The data obtained suggest that alterations in Ca2+ buffering may provide a potent mechanism by which the localized spread of astrocytic Ca2+ signals is controlled.},

To detect and characterize changes in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) that might be expected to be triggered by stimulation with serotonin (5-HT), we have carried out digital calcium-imaging experiments on intact glands using the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2. 2. 5- HT (1-10 nM) induced repetitive transient increases in [Ca2+]i, i.e. Ca2+ spikes whose frequency was a function of agonist concentration (EC50 = 2.8 nM). 3. Pre-incubation in EGTA decreased the frequency but did not inhibit spiking. Thapsigargin abolished periodic spike activity indicating that the [Ca2+]i rise results from Ca2+ release. Neither caffeine (10 mM) nor ryanodine (10 and 50 microM) induced increases in [Ca2+]i. 4. Oscillatory activity in individual cells was synchronized by regenerative intercellular Ca2+ waves that propagated over distances greater than 400 microm. Colliding waves annihilated each other. 5. Desynchronization of the oscillation pattern by 100 microM 1-octanol suggests the involvement of gap junctions and an intracellular messenger in wave propagation. 6. Local stimulation of glands elicited [Ca2+]i elevations in the stimulated area, but not in adjacent cells, indicating that local increases in [Ca2+]i are not sufficient to trigger Ca2+ waves. However, local stimulation was capable of evoking propagating Ca2+ waves when combined with low-dose 5-HT stimulation of the whole gland. 7. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that: (1) Ca2+ acts as the intercellular messenger and modulates its own release via positive and negative feedback on the inosital 1,4,5- trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor, and (2) sensitization of the InsP3 receptor to Ca2+ by InsP3 is required for the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves, as proposed for intracellular Ca2+ waves in Xenopus oocytes.},

We measured [Ca2+]i and Mn2+ entry in single cells of the pancreatic acinar cell line AR42J loaded with Fura 2 to examine the behavior of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (Ca2+ entry) during agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillation. Addition of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+out) to agonist-stimulated cells bathed in Ca2(+)-free medium resulted in a marked [Ca2+]i increase blocked by La3+. The use of Mn2+ as a congener of Ca2+ to follow unidirectional Ca2+ movement reveals an oscillatory activation of Ca2+ entry by Ca2(+)-mobilizing agonists. The frequency at which Ca2+ entry oscillated matched the frequency of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Ca2+ entry is activated after completion of Ca2+ release and is inactivated within the time span of each [Ca2+]i spike. These studies reveal a new aspect of [Ca2+]i oscillation in agonist-stimulated cells, that is the oscillatory activation of [Ca2+]i entry during [Ca2+]i oscillation.},

	Abstract = {A permeable cell system in which Ca2+ release can be evoked by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or agonist stimulation was used to study the regulation of Ca2+ release by Ca2+ itself. At low concentrations, Ca2+ activated IP3-mediated Ca2+ release (IMCR) with half-maximal effect at about 15 nM. At high concentrations, Ca2+ inhibited IMCR giving rise to a biphasic [Ca2+] dependence of IMCR. The activation of IMCR by Ca2+ appears to be mediated by a kinase, probably the Ca(2+)-and calmodulin- dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). Thus, the activation required MgATP, completely blocked at 0 degrees C, required Ca2+, and was inhibited by the CaMKII inhibitors KT5926 and KN62. The inhibition of IMCR seems to be mediated by a protein phosphatase, probably the Ca(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase 2B. Hence, the inhibition required Ca2+, was prevented by the general protein phosphatase inhibitor pyrophosphate and by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506, but not by okadaic acid or VO4(2-), and was modified by chelating agents such as EGTA. Stimulation with agonists modified the activities of the kinase and phosphatase to make the release independent of [Ca2+]. This appears to be due to an increase in the apparent affinity for Ca2+ in stimulating IMCR and inhibition of the phosphatase. We suggest that agonist-dependent modification of the kinase/phosphatase activity ratio can be the biochemical pathway responsible for regulation of Ca2+ release and in turn [Ca2+]i oscillations.},

Addition of heparin prior to or after agonist stimulation inhibited the release, indicating the activation of the Ins-1,4,5-P3-dependent Ca2+ channels by the agonist. Termination of cell stimulation with the specific antagonist atropine rapidly inactivated the release channels.

Among these, signal transduction can be coordinated among several cells due to gap junctional permeability to intracellular second messengers.

Digital imaging fluorescence microscopy of Fura-2 loaded cells was used to monitor Ca2+ in confluent and semi-confluent cell layers. Under these conditions, Ca2+ spikes propagate from cell to cell giving rise to intercellular Ca2+ waves. The functional expression of gap junctions was assessed, in confluent chondrocyte cultures, by the intercellular transfer of Lucifer yellow dye in scrape-loading experiments. Intercellular dye transfer was blocked by the gap junction inhibitor 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid. In imaging experiments, the inhibitor caused the loss of synchrony of ATP-induced Ca2+ oscillations, and blocked the intercellular Ca2+ propagation induced by mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a monolayer. It is concluded that gap junctions mediate intercellular signal transduction in cartilage cells and may provide a mechanism for co-ordinating their metabolic activity.},

In these cells a number of studies have contributed to demonstrate that the combination of these two properties provides a basis for a long-range signaling system within the brain. Intercellular calcium signaling, also termed calcium waves, allows astrocytes to communicate with each other and to interact with adjacent neurons. Most of the intra- and inter-cellular events involved in the initiation and propagation phases of this process has now been identified. This sequence of events includes the permeability of gap junction channels, which at the time-scale for calcium waves propagation, are likely permeated rather than closed by Ca2+ and/or related signaling molecules like IP3. In addition, in some studies an external component have been reported to participate to the propagation process. Finally, the control of the spread of intercellular calcium signaling has been demonstrated to occur at several levels including phospholipase C, IP3 receptors, intracellular Ca2+ stores, and cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering. Accordingly, normal and pathological situations that affect one or several of these steps can be predicted to influence on astrocytic calcium waves.},

	Abstract = {Electrically permeabilized rat pancreatic acini were used to evaluate the contributions of GTP and Ins(1,4,5) P3 to hormone-stimulated Ca2+ uptake and release from intracellular pools. Treatment of permeabilized acini with Ca2+-mobilizing hormones, GTP or GTP[S] resulted in stimulation of an ATP-dependent, VO4(2-)-sensitive Ca2+ uptake into a non-mitochondrial intracellular pool. GTP and GTP[S] also augmented the hormone-mediated stimulation of Ca2+ uptake. Including oxalate in the uptake medium increased Ca2+ uptake into this pool but did not modify the stimulation of Ca2+ uptake induced by hormones or GTP. Ins(1,4,5)P3 released all the extra Ca2+ accumulated as a result of hormone, GTP or GTP[S] stimulation. Hence, these stimuli activated the Ca2+ pump localized in the membrane of the hormone and Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ pool. Including 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (PGA) [an inhibitor of Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolysis] in the incubation medium blunted the GTP and GTP[S]-stimulated Ca2+ uptake. In the presence of PGA, the hormones inhibited Ca2+ accumulation, and GTP and GTP[S] augmented this effect. Accordingly, PGA stabilized the Ins(1,4,5)P3-evoked Ca2+ release from intracellular pools. Only in the presence of PGA was it possible to demonstrate hormonally-evoked Ca2+ release from permeabilized cells. GTP, and more importantly GTP[S], augmented the hormone-evoked Ca2+ release. Hormones and Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the presence or absence of GTP or GTP[S] released Ca2+ from the same intracellular pool. The extent of Ca2+ release caused by the combination of hormones and GTP or GTP[S] was similar to that evoked by Ins(1,4,5)P3 alone. Taken together, these results suggest that GTP or GTP[S] facilitates stimulation of phospholipase C by hormones. Such stimulation results in stimulation of protein kinase C and increased levels of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and is sufficient to explain the effects of GTP and GTP[S] on Ca2+ uptake and release from pancreatic acinar cells.},

	Abstract = {Changes in intracellular calcium were monitored in cultured cortical astrocytes stimulated with albumin. Albumin elicited intracellular calcium mobilisation from intracellular stores, inducing repetitive intracellular calcium oscillations. The oscillations were not blocked by ryanodine, a blocker of the Ca-induced Ca release mechanism, and the release occurred from the same store as is accessed by glutamate and bradykinin, both of which release calcium by an IP3-dependent mechanism. Calcium signals induced by albumin appear therefore to occur via a pure IP3-dependent mechanism. When albumin was applied to confluent monolayers of astrocytes, the oscillations in individual cells were initially unsynchronised, but after several minutes of application, the Ca2 oscillations were observed to synchronise and spread through the astrocyte network as a wave. These intercellular calcium waves were inhibited by the gap junction blocker halothane. Using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique, we demonstrate that the development of propagated waves with prolonged exposure to albumin does not result from an increase in cell coupling. The development of calcium waves on exposure to albumin may be important in the formation of glial scars in the CNS after breakdown of the blood-brain barrier.},

	Abstract = {Gap junctions are regarded as the primary pathway underlying propagation of Ca2+ waves between astrocytes, although signaling through extracellular space may also contribute. Results obtained from astrocytes cultured from sibling Cx43 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice in six litters showed that Ca2+ waves propagated more slowly in Cx43 KO than in WT astrocytes; however, because this difference in velocity was only seen in conditions where cell confluence was higher in WT than KO astrocytes, it is attributable to differences in plating density. By contrast, density-independent differences were observed in the amplitudes of the Ca2+ responses (15% smaller in KO astrocytes) and efficacy of spread (to 14% fewer cells in KO astrocytes). Blockade of purinergic receptors with suramin reduced the velocities of the waves by 40% in WT and KO astrocytes and reduced the amplitudes by 20% and 6%, respectively. In the presence of heptanol, Ca2+ waves spread to only 30% of the cells, with a 70% reduced velocity and 30% reduced amplitude. It is concluded that the propagation of Ca2+ waves between astrocytes from Cx43 KO mice is not so greatly affected as expected by deletion of the major gap junction protein between these cells. The residual 5% coupling contributed by the additional connexins (Cx40, Cx45, and Cx46) expressed in KO astrocytes still suffices to provide a more substantial portion of Ca2+ wave propagation than does signaling through extracellular purinergic pathways. These studies demonstrate that, even with severely reduced junctional conductance, Cx43 KO astrocytes are capable of performing long-range Ca2+ wave signaling, perhaps preserving one mechanism critical to neural function.},

	Abstract = {Regulation of agonist-activated Ca2+ influx by the NOS pathway through generation of cGMP is being found in an increasing number of cell types. In the present work, we examined the role of the NOS pathway in agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations and attempted to identify the NOS isoform most likely to regulate Ca2+ influx. For this, we first show that two Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists acting on pancreatic acinar cells, bombesin (BS) and the cholecystokinin analog CCK-JMV-180 (CCKJ), evokes different type of [Ca2+]i oscillations. The BS-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations rapidly became acutely dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, whereas the CCKJ-evoked oscillations continue for long periods of time in the absence of Ca2+ influx. This differential behavior allowed us to isolate Ca2+ influx and study its regulation while controlling for non specific effects on all other Ca2+ transporting events involved in generating [Ca2+]i oscillations. Inhibitors of selective steps in the NOS pathway inhibited agonist- induced cGMP production. The inhibitors were then used to show that scavenging NO with reduced hemoglobin, inhibition of guanylyl cyclase with 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a] quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ) and inhibition of protein kinase G with Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS inhibited [Ca2+]i oscillations evoked by BS but not those evoked by CCKJ. These findings were extended to duct and acinar cells of the SMG. In these cells, Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists stimulate large Ca2+ influx, which was inhibited by all inhibitors of the NOS pathway. Western blot analysis and immunolocalization revealed that the cells did not express iNOS, eNOS was expressed only in blood vessels and capillaries whereas nNOS was expressed at high levels next to the plasma membrane of all cells. Accordingly, the nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) inhibited BS- but not CCKJ-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations and Ca2+ influx into SMG acinar and duct cells. Thus, together, our findings favor nNOS as the isoform activated by the Ca2+ released from internal stores to generate cGMP and regulate Ca2+ influx.},

	Abstract = {Intercellular propagation of a diffusible substance through direct cytoplasmic communication between multiple cells could represent an important mechanism for mutual multiple cell signaling between cells in a tissue. The current study was aimed at characterizing the mechanism(s) underlying the intercellular propagation of calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients between colonic smooth muscle cells. Changes in [Ca2+]i in smooth muscle cells from the rabbit distal colon in primary cultures were monitored using videomicroscopy with the fluorescent dye Fura-2. Myocytes responded to light mechanical deformation of the plasma membrane with a localized increase in [Ca2+]i which spread in a wave-like fashion through up to 5 adjacent cells, with little change in wave amplitude. Dye coupling between cells was demonstrated by Lucifer Yellow, and intercellular wave propagation was abolished by octanol, suggesting propagation of Ca2+ waves via gap junctions. Wave propagation was not dependent on extracellular [Ca2+]i suggesting regenerative release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Propagation of Ca2+ waves through silent cells suggested a diffusible messenger other than Ca2+. Wave propagation and kinetics were unaffected by ryanodine (50 microM) or caffeine (10 mM), but abolished by depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores and by the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 (10 microM), implicating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-sensitive stores as the major Ca2+ source for propagated Ca2+ transients. These results indicate that, in a connected complex of colonic smooth muscle cells in culture, multiple cells can monitor the mechanical status of a single cell through diffusion of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ca2+, or another intercellular messenger.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium waves were observed in cultured human myometrium using confocal laser scanning microscopy in the epifluorescence mode. Intracellular calcium waves were observed following stimulation of the cells with 10 mU ml-1 oxytocin in physiological bathing solution, or following substitution of tetraethylammonium chloride for NaCl. Intracellular wave speeds were 18.9 +/- 8.2 microns s-1 in physiological bathing solution. Intracellular calcium waves were also observed in cells bathed in calcium-free solutions, with no significant differences in wave speeds. Calcium waves that crossed cell boundaries were also observed. Some intercellular calcium waves travelled large distances (> 500 microns). Wave speeds for intercellular waves were 7.8 +/- 1.6 microns s-1. Attempts to use octanol to determine the contribution of gap junctions to intercellular calcium wave propagation were unsuccessful because of direct effects of 2 mM octanol on calcium oscillations. These data demonstrate that intra- and intercellular calcium waves are a means of tissue level communication in myometrium that is distinct from action potentials with regard to mechanisms of action, propagation speeds, responses to stimuli, and responses to inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {The ER is a central element in Ca(2+) signaling, both as a modulator of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and as a locus of Ca(2+)- regulated events. During surface membrane depolarization in excitable cells, the ER may either accumulate or release net Ca(2+), but the conditions of stimulation that determine which form of net Ca(2+) transport occurs are not well understood. The direction of net ER Ca(2+) transport depends on the relative rates of Ca(2+) uptake and release via distinct pathways that are differentially regulated by Ca(2+), so we investigated these rates and their sensitivity to Ca(2+) using sympathetic neurons as model cells. The rate of Ca(2+) uptake by SERCAs (J(SERCA)), measured as the t-BuBHQ-sensitive component of the total cytoplasmic Ca(2+) flux, increased monotonically with [Ca(2+)](i). Measurement of the rate of Ca(2+) release (J(Release)) during t-BuBHQ-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients made it possible to characterize the Ca(2+) permeability of the ER ((~)P(ER)), describing the activity of all Ca(2+)-permeable channels that contribute to passive ER Ca(2+) release, including ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) release channels (RyRs) that are responsible for CICR. Simulations based on experimentally determined descriptions of J(SERCA), and of Ca(2+) extrusion across the plasma membrane (J(pm)) accounted for our previous finding that during weak depolarization, the ER accumulates Ca(2+), but at a rate that is attenuated by activation of a CICR pathway operating in parallel with SERCAs to regulate net ER Ca(2+) transport. Caffeine greatly increased the [Ca(2+)] sensitivity of ((~)P(ER)), accounting for the effects of caffeine on depolarization-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) elevations and caffeine-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. Extending the rate descriptions of J(SERCA), ((~)P(ER)), and J(pm) to higher [Ca(2+)](i) levels shows how the interplay between Ca(2+) transport systems with different Ca(2+) sensitivities accounts for the different modes of CICR over different ranges of [Ca(2+)](i) during stimulation.},

	Abstract = {1. Digital imaging and photometry were used in conjunction with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, Fura-2, to examine intracellular Ca2+ signals produced by depolarization of single adrenal chromaffin cells. 2. Depolarization with a patch pipette produced radial gradients of Ca2+ within the cell, with Ca2+ concentration highest in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. These gradients dissipated within a few hundred milliseconds when the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were closed. 3. Dialysis of Fura-2 into the chromaffin cell caused concentration-dependent changes in the depolarization-induced Ca2+ signal, decreasing its magnitude and slowing its recovery time course. These changes were used to estimate the properties of the endogenous cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffer with which Fura-2 competes for Ca2+. 4. The spatially averaged Fura-2 signal was well described by a model assuming fast competition between Fura-2 and an endogenous buffer on a millisecond time scale. Retrieval of calcium by pumps and slow buffers occurs on a seconds-long time scale. No temporal changes indicative of buffers with intermediate kinetics could be detected. 5. Two independent estimates of the capacity of the fast endogenous Ca2+ buffer suggest that 98-99% of the Ca2+ entering the cell normally is taken up by this buffer. This buffer appears to be immobile, because it does not wash out of the cell during dialysis. It has a low affinity for Ca2+ ions, because it does not saturate with 1 microM-Ca2+ inside the cell. 6. The low capacity, affinity and mobility of the endogenous Ca2+ buffer makes it possible for relatively small amounts of exogenous Ca2+ buffers, such as Fura-2, to exert a significant influence on the characteristics of the Ca2+ concentration signal as measured by fluorescence ratios. On the other hand, even at moderate Fura-2 concentrations (0.4 mM) Fura-2 will dominate over the endogenous buffers. Under these conditions radiometric Ca2+ concentration signals are largely attenuated, but absolute fluorescence changes (at 390 nm) accurately reflect calcium fluxes.},

	Abstract = {A novel Nipkow-type confocal microscope was applied to image spontaneously propagating Ca2+ waves in isolated rat ventricular myocytes by means of fluo-3. The sarcolemma was imaged with di-8-ANEPPS and the nucleus with SYTO 11. Full frame images in different vertical sections were obtained at video frame rate by means of an intensified CCD camera. Three types of Ca2+ waves were identified: spherical waves, planar waves, and spiral waves. Both spherical waves and spiral waves could initiate a planar wave, and planar waves were not influenced by the presence of a nucleus. Spiral waves, however, were consistently found adjacent to a nucleus and displayed a slower propagation rate and slower rate of increase in Ca2+ concentration in the wave front than did spherical and planar waves. The planar waves were apparent throughout the vertical axis of the cell, whereas spiral waves appeared to have a vertical height of approximately 3 microm, less than the maximum thickness of the nucleus (5.0 +/- 0.3 microm). These results provide experimental confirmation of previous modeling studies which predicted an influence of the nucleus on spiral-type Ca2+ waves. When a spontaneous Ca2+ wave is small relative to the size of the nucleus, it appears that the Ca2+ buffering by the nucleus is sufficient to slow the rate of spontaneous propagation of the Ca2+ wave in close proximity to the nucleus. These findings thus support the idea that the nucleus can influence complex behavior of Ca2+ waves in isolated cardiac myocytes.},

In addition to our review, we also report: (i) the existence and characterization of rapid agonist-induced [Ca2+]i-waves in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5 cells); and (ii a new method for studying rapid [Ca2+]i-waves in mammalian cardiac ventricular cells. In mammalian cardiac muscle several types of Ca(2+)-release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) are known to occur and might be involved in Ca(2+)-waves and Ca(2+)-oscillations: (a) Ca(2+)-induced release of Ca2+, of the type thought to be important in normal excitation-contraction coupling; (b) spontaneous, cyclic release of Ca2+ related to a Ca(2+)-overload of the SR; and (c) Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca(2+)-release. The available data support the idea that [Ca2+]i-waves in heart propagate by a mechanism somewhat different than that involved in normal excitation-contraction coupling (a, above), perhaps involving spontaneous release of Ca2+ from an overloaded SR (b, above). In mammalian vascular smooth muscle, our data support the idea that agonist-receptor interaction (vasopressin, in this case) initiates [Ca2+]i-waves that then propagate via some form of Ca(2+)-induced release of Ca2+, perhaps in a manner similar to that proposed by Berridge and Irvine [1].},

	Abstract = {The [Ca2+]i transient in heart is now thought to involve the recruitment and summation of discrete and independent "units" of Ca2+ release (Ca2+ "sparks") from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, each of which is controlled locally by single coassociated L-type Ca2+ channels ("local control theory of excitation-contraction coupling"). All prior studies on Ca2+ sparks, however, have been performed in single enzymatically dissociated heart cells under nonphysiological conditions. In order to understand the possible significance of Ca2+ sparks to normal working cardiac muscle, we used confocal microscopy to record Ca2+ sparks, spatially averaged [Ca2+]i transients and Ca2+ waves in individual cells of intact rat right ventricular trabeculae (composed of < 15 cells in cross section) microinjected with the Ca2+ indicator fluo 3 under physiological conditions ([Ca2+]o, 1 mmol/L; temperature, 33 +/- 1 degree C). Twitch force was recorded simultaneously. When stretched to optimal length (sarcomere length, 2.2 microns) and stimulated at 0.2 Hz, the trabeculae generated approximately equal to 700 micrograms of force per cell. Spatially averaged [Ca2+]i transients recorded from individual cells within a trabecula were similar to those recorded previously from single cells. The amplitude distribution of the peak ratio of Ca2+ sparks was bimodal, with maxima at ratios of 1.8 +/- 0.3 and 2.7 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SD), respectively. The amplitude of the peak of Ca2+ sparks was approximately equal to 170 nmol/L. Ca2+ sparks occurred at a frequency of 12.0 +/- 0.8/s (mean +/- SEM) in line scans covering 94 sarcomeres. Ca2+ waves occurred randomly at a frequency of 0.57 +/- 0.08/s and propagated with a velocity of 29.5 +/- 1.7 microns/s. The extent of Ca2+ wave propagation was 3.9 +/- 0.3 sarcomere lengths (sarcomere length, 2.2 microns). Ca2+ sparks could be identified along the leading edge of the waves at intervals of 1.30 +/- 0.11 sarcomere length. Our observations suggest that (1) Ca2+ sparks, similar to those recorded in single cells, occur in trabeculae under physiological conditions and (2) coupling of Ca2+ spark generation between neighboring sites occurs and may lead to (3) the development of Ca2+ waves, which propagate under physiological conditions at a low velocity over limited distances. The results suggest that concepts of excitation-contraction coupling recently derived from isolated myocytes are applicable to intact cardiac trabeculae [corrected].},

	Abstract = {In the presence of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (InsP3) repetitive waves of elevated cytosolic free Ca2+ (Ca waves) that travel through cellular cytoplasm are observed. Investigation of this phenomenon stimulated the view of cellular cytoplasm as 'an excitable medium composed of Ca release processes (InsP3R), coupled by a common stimulatory signal (Ca) through diffusion' [Lechleiter JD. Clapham DE. (1992) Molecular mechanisms of intracellular calcium excitability in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Cell, 69, 283-294]. Using a kinetic model of InsP3R gating, an analytical expression for the amplitude of Ca wave propagating through this excitable medium has been obtained. The amplitude of the Ca wave is determined by the combination of cell- specific parameters and the functional properties of a single InsP3R. An analytical expression for Ca wave propagation velocity has been also obtained using the Luther equation for diffusion-driven autocatalytic reaction. Both equations provided reasonable estimations for Ca wave amplitude (1.3 microM free Ca) and the velocity of the wave propagation (21 microns/s) for Ca waves in Xenopus oocytes when numerical values of parameters were used. The duration of refractory period has been shown to be determined mainly by the activity of CaATPase. Obtained results provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying the process of Ca wave propagation and define the interrelationship between different factors involved in this process. Some experimentally testable predictions can be done based on the analytical expressions obtained for Ca wave amplitude, the velocity of Ca wave propagation and the duration of refractory period.},

	Abstract = {The kinetics of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (InsP3)-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores are unusual in that submaximal concentrations of InsP3 rapidly release only a fraction of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores. By measuring unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux from permeabilized rat hepatocytes, we demonstrate that such quantal responses to InsP3 occur at all temperatures between 2 and 37 degrees C, but at much lower rates at the lower temperatures. Preincubation with submaximal concentrations of InsP3, which themselves evoked quantal Ca2+ release, had no effect on the sensitivity of the stores to further additions of InsP3. The final Ca2+ content of the stores was the same whether they were stimulated with two submaximal doses of InsP3 or a single addition of the sum of these doses. Such incremental responses and the persistence of quantal behaviour at 2 degrees C indicate that InsP3-evoked receptor inactivation is unlikely to be the cause of quantal Ca2+ mobilization. Reducing the Ca2+ content of the intracellular stores by up to 45% did not affect their sensitivity to InsP3, but substantially reduced the time taken for each submaximal InsP3 concentration to exert its full effect. These results suggest that neither luminal nor cytosolic Ca2+ regulation of InsP3 receptors are the determinants of quantal behaviour. Our results are not therefore consistent with incremental responses to InsP3 depending on mechanisms involving attenuation of InsP3 receptor function by cytosolic or luminal Ca2+ or by InsP3 binding itself. We conclude that incremental activation of Ca2+ release results from all-or-nothing emptying of stores with heterogeneous sensitivities to InsP3. These characteristics allow rapid graded recruitment of InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores as the cytosolic InsP3 concentration increases.},

We study this model in one dimension, analytically in the limit of a large number of channels per site N, and numerically for small N. As the number of channels per site is increased, the transition from a nonpropagating region of activity to a propagating one changes from one described by directed percolation to that of deterministic depinning in a spatially discrete system. Also, for a small number of channels a propagating calcium wave can leave behind a novel fluctuation-driven state.},

@article{adkins1999,
	Abstract = {Ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors - two related families of Ca(2+) channels responsible for release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores [1] - are biphasically regulated by cytosolic Ca(2+) [2] [3] [4]. It is thought that the resulting positive feedback allows localised Ca(2+)-release events to propagate regeneratively, and that the negative feedback limits the amplitude of individual events [5] [6]. Stimulation of IP(3) receptors by Ca(2+) occurs through a Ca(2+)-binding site that becomes exposed only after IP(3) has bound to its receptor [7] [8]. Here, we report that rapid inhibition of IP(3) receptors by Ca(2+) occurs only if the receptor has not bound IP(3). The IP(3) therefore switches its receptor from a state in which only an inhibitory Ca(2+)-binding site is accessible to one in which only a stimulatory site is available. This regulation ensures that Ca(2+) released by an active IP(3) receptor may rapidly inhibit its unliganded neighbours, but it cannot terminate the activity of a receptor with IP(3) bound. Such lateral inhibition, which is a universal feature of sensory systems where it improves contrast and dynamic range, may fulfil similar roles in intracellular Ca(2+) signalling by providing increased sensitivity to IP(3) and allowing rapid graded recruitment of IP(3) receptors.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) liberation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) is 'quantal', in that low [IP(3)] causes only partial Ca(2+) release, but further increasing [IP(3)] evokes more release. This characteristic allows cells to generate graded Ca(2+) signals, but is unexpected, given the regenerative nature of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release through IP(3) receptors. Two models have been proposed to resolve this paradox: (i) all-or-none Ca(2+) release from heterogeneous stores that empty at varying [IP(3)]; and (ii) phasic liberation from homogeneously sensitive stores. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we imaged subcellular Ca(2+) puffs evoked by IP(3) in XENOPUS: oocytes where release sites were functionally uncoupled using EGTA. Puffs were little changed by 300 microM intracellular EGTA, but sites operated autonomously and did not propagate waves. Photoreleased IP(3) generated flurries of puffs-different to the prolonged Ca(2+) elevation following waves in control cells-and individual sites responded repeatedly to successive increments of [IP(3)]. These data support the second hypothesis while refuting the first, and suggest that local Ca(2+) signals exhibit rapid adaptation, different to the slower inhibition following global Ca(2+) waves.},

	Abstract = {In almost all cells, cytosolic Ca(2+) is a crucial intracellular messenger, regulating many cellular processes. In non-excitable as well as in some excitable cells, Ca(2+) release from the intracellular stores into the cytoplasm is primarily initiated by the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), which interacts with the IP(3) receptor (IP(3)R), a tetrameric intracellular Ca(2+)-release channel. This review focuses on the pharmacological modulation of the various functionally important sub-domains of the IP(3)R, including the IP(3)-binding domain, calmodulin-binding sites, adenine nucleotide-binding sites and the sites for interaction for FK506-binding proteins and other regulators. We will particularly focus on the pharmacological tools that interfere with these domains and discuss their relative specificity for the IP(3)R, thereby indicating their potential usefulness for unraveling the complex functional regulation of the IP(3)R.},

	Abstract = {Acetylcholine-evoked secretion from the parotid gland is substantially potentiated by cAMP-raising agonists. A potential locus for the action of cAMP is the intracellular signaling pathway resulting in elevated cytosolic calcium levels ([Ca(2+)](i)). This hypothesis was tested in mouse parotid acinar cells. Forskolin dramatically potentiated the carbachol-evoked increase in [Ca(2+)](i), converted oscillatory [Ca(2+)](i) changes into a sustained [Ca(2+)](i) increase, and caused subthreshold concentrations of carbachol to increase [Ca(2+)](i) measurably. This potentiation was found to be independent of Ca(2+) entry and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) production, suggesting that cAMP-mediated effects on Ca(2+) release was the major underlying mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis, dibutyryl cAMP dramatically potentiated InsP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) release from streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells. Furthermore, type II InsP(3) receptors (InsP(3)R) were shown to be directly phosphorylated by a protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated mechanism after treatment with forskolin. In contrast, no evidence was obtained to support direct PKA-mediated activation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs). However, inhibition of RyRs in intact cells, demonstrated a role for RyRs in propagating Ca(2+) oscillations and amplifying potentiated Ca(2+) release from InsP(3)Rs. These data indicate that potentiation of Ca(2+) release is primarily the result of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of InsP(3)Rs, and may largely explain the synergistic relationship between cAMP-raising agonists and acetylcholine-evoked secretion in the parotid. In addition, this report supports the emerging consensus that phosphorylation at the level of the Ca(2+) release machinery is a broadly important mechanism by which cells can regulate Ca(2+)-mediated processes.},

	Abstract = {1. Histamine-stimulated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores was monitored in intact and permeabilized populations of HeLa cells using both the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 and 45Ca2+ measurements. Digital video imaging of Fura-2-loaded cells was used to measure the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of single cells. 2. In populations of HeLa cells, histamine caused a concentration-dependent increase in cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. The initial transient increase was independent of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o) and was followed by a sustained increase that was abolished by removal of Ca2+o. 3. In Ca(2+)-free medium ([Ca2+]o < 1 microM), a maximal histamine concentration (25 microM) caused a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, and a subsequent challenge with histamine failed to evoke a further response indicating that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive Ca2+ stores had been completely emptied. Lower concentrations of histamine (0.5-10 microM) caused smaller, concentration-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i that were also transient. After exposure to these low histamine concentrations, where [Ca2+]i returned to baseline within 2 min, addition of a higher histamine concentration evoked a further increase in [Ca2+]i. The second increase in [Ca2+]i was inversely proportional to the increase caused by the first exposure to histamine, indicating that Ca2+ released in the initial response was not substantially resequestered into histamine-sensitive stores. 4. Single HeLa cells challenged with low concentrations of histamine in Ca(2+)-free medium responded with transient increases in [Ca2+]i, but individual cells differed in their sensitivity with 51% of cells responding to 1 microM, and 98% responding to 25 microM-histamine. 5. When single cells in Ca(2+)-free medium were challenged with stepwise increases in histamine concentration, they responded to each step with a transient [Ca2+]i increase after which [Ca2+]i returned to baseline within 1 min. Prolonging the interval between histamine additions by up to 25 min did not affect the [Ca2+]i increase evoked by a subsequent histamine addition. 6. Unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux from saponin-permeabilized HeLa cells showed that, under conditions that prevented Ca2+ resequestration, submaximal concentrations of InsP3 rapidly emptied only a fraction of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores. The failure of low InsP3 concentrations to fully mobilize the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores was not a consequence of InsP3 degradation. 7. We conclude that within single HeLa cells, intracellular Ca2+ stores are heterogeneous in their sensitivity to InsP3, and the fraction of Ca2+ stores mobilized by InsP3 increases as the InsP3 concentration increases.},

	Abstract = {The quantal behaviour of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors allows rapid graded release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, but the mechanisms are unknown. In Ca2+-depleted stores loaded with Fura 2, InsP3 caused concentration dependent increases in the rates of fluorescence quench by Mn2+ that were unaffected by prior incubation with InsP3, indicating that InsP3 binding did not cause desensitization. When Fura 2 was used to report the luminal free [Ca2+] after inhibition of further Ca2+ uptake, submaximal concentrations of InsP3 caused rapid, partial decreases in fluorescence ratios. Subsequent addition of a maximal InsP3 concentration caused the fluorescence to fall to within 5% of that recorded after ionomycin. Addition of all but the lowest concentrations of InsP3 to stores loaded with the lower affinity indicator, Calcium Green-5N, caused almost complete emptying of the stores at rates that increased with InsP3 concentration. The lowest concentration of InsP3 (10 nM) slowly emptied approximately 80% of the stores, but within 3 min the rate of Ca2+ release slowed leaving approximately 7 microM Ca2+ within the stores, which was then rapidly released by a maximal InsP3 concentration. In stores co-loaded with both indicators, InsP3-evoked Ca2+ release appeared quantal with Fura 2 and largely non-quantal with Calcium Green-5N; the discrepancy is not, therefore, a direct effect of the indicators. The fall in luminal [Ca2+] after activation of InsP3 receptors may, therefore, cause their inactivation, but only after the Ca2+ content of the stores has fallen by approximately 95% to < or = 10 microM.},

We failed to detect a major effect of intralumenal Ca2+ in regulating this release, as various manipulations in which the load of the Ca2+ pools was varied by a factor of two did not significantly affect the apparent relative efficiency of InsP3 in releasing Ca2+; these manipulations included loading the Ca2+ pools up to various steady state levels by preliminary equilibration at various external free Ca2+ concentrations, as well as emptying them progressively through the blockade of pump-mediated Ca2+ uptake. As regards Ca2+ on the cytosolic side, in contrast with recent results obtained with other systems, we found that, at maximal doses, InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was not stimulated by raising Ca2+ from very low to submicromolar or micromolar concentrations, and that only relatively high concentrations of free Ca2+ inhibited this release (half-maximal inhibition was between 3 and 15 microM). Such elevated Ca2+ concentrations reduced the size of the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool. We also noted that the apparent cooperativity of InsP3 activation of release at pCa 5 was noticeably less than that observed at pCa 7. As a result, at low InsP3 concentrations, a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ from pCa 7 to pCa 5 stimulated InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release. These results are discussed in the context of the current speculations about tissue specificity, heterogeneity, quantal release, oscillations, and the several different mechanisms that may control InsP3-induced Ca2+ release.},

	Abstract = {The release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores via InsP(3) receptors shows anomalous kinetics. Successive additions of low concentrations of InsP(3) cause successive rapid transients of Ca(2+) release. These quantal responses have been ascribed to all-or-none release from stores with differing sensitivities to InsP(3) or, alternatively, to a steady-state mechanism where complex kinetic properties of the InsP(3) receptor allow partial emptying of all the stores. We present here an adaptive model of the InsP(3) receptor that can show either pattern, depending on the imposed experimental conditions. The model proposes two interconvertible conformational states of the receptor: one state binds InsP(3) rapidly, but with low affinity, whereas the other state binds slowly, but with high affinity. The model shows repetitive increments of Ca(2+) release in the absence of a Ca(2+) gradient, but more pronounced incremental behaviour when released Ca(2+) builds up at the mouth of the channel. The sensitivity to Ins P (3) is critically dependent on the density of InsP(3) receptors, so that different stores can respond to different concentration ranges of Ins P (3). Since the model generates very high Hill coefficients (h approximately 7), it allows all-or-none release of Ca(2+) from stores of differing receptor density, but questions the validity of the use of h values as a guide to the number of InsP(3) molecules needed to open the channel. The model presents a mechanism for terminating Ca(2+) release in the presence of positive feedback from released Ca(2+), thereby providing an explanation of why elementary Ca(2+) signals ('blips' and 'puffs') do not inevitably turn into regenerative waves.},

This autoamplification process is also very apparent when voltage-clamped or Ca(2+)-overloaded myocytes exhibit fast-propagating Ca2+ waves. Although most of the fronts are planar, some adopt a spiral shape, revealing additional characteristics about the excitability and structure of the cardiac cell (P. Lipp and E. Niggli, Biophys.

A region of the cell lacking Ca2+ pools, acting as an obstacle able to break the propagation of planar waves, suffices to initiate a spiral wave; however, this region must be properly placed with respect to the pacemaker. An obstacle behaving as a barrier to diffusion is also able to create the initial bending that can lead to the spiral wave. We study how the occurrence of spiral Ca2+ waves in single cardiomyocytes is influenced by factors such as the stimulus location and the position, shape, and dimensions of the obstacle to planar wave propagation.},

Multiple isoforms with distinct InsP(3) binding properties () have been identified (). The type III InsP(3)R lacks Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition, a property that makes it ideal for signal initiation (). Regulation of the type III InsP(3)R by InsP(3) and ATP was explored in detail using planar lipid bilayers. In comparison to the type I InsP(3)R, the type III InsP(3)R required a higher concentration of InsP(3) to reach maximal channel activity (EC(50) of 3.2 microM versus 0.5 microM for the types III and I InsP(3)R, respectively). However, the type III InsP(3)R did reach a 2.5-fold higher level of activity. Although activation by InsP(3) was isoform-specific, regulation by ATP was similar for both isoforms. In the presence of 2 microM InsP(3), low ATP concentrations (<6 mM) increased the open probability and mean open time. High ATP concentrations (>6 mM) decreased channel activity. These results illustrate the complex nature of type III InsP(3)R regulation. Enhanced channel activity in the presence of high InsP(3) may be important during periods of prolonged stimulation, whereas allosteric modulation by ATP may help to modulate intracellular Ca(2+) signaling.},

	Abstract = {Hormones and neurotransmitters that act through inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (IP3) can induce oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c), which render dynamic regulation of intracellular targets. Imaging of fluorescent Ca2+ indicators located within intracellular Ca2+ stores was used to monitor IP3 receptor channel (IP3R) function and to demonstrate that IP3-dependent oscillations of Ca2+ release and re-uptake can be reproduced in single permeabilized hepatocytes. This system was used to define the minimum essential components of the oscillation mechanism. With IP3 clamped at a submaximal concentration, coordinated cycles of IP3R activation and subsequent inactivation were observed in each cell. Cycling between these states was dependent on feedback effects of released Ca2+ and the ensuing [Ca2+]c increase, but did not require Ca2+ re-accumulation. [Ca2+]c can act at distinct stimulatory and inhibitory sites on the IP3R, but whereas the Ca2+ release phase was driven by a Ca2+-induced increase in IP3 sensitivity, Ca2+ release could be terminated by intrinsic inactivation after IP3 bound to the Ca2+-sensitized IP3R without occupation of the inhibitory Ca2+-binding site. These findings were confirmed using Sr2+, which only interacts with the stimulatory site. Moreover, vasopressin induced Sr2+ oscillations in intact cells in which intracellular Ca2+ was completely replaced with Sr2+. Thus, [Ca2+]c oscillations can be driven by a coupled process of Ca2+-induced activation and obligatory intrinsic inactivation of the Ca2+-sensitized state of the IP3R, without a requirement for occupation of the inhibitory Ca2+-binding site.},

	Abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced Ca2+ release depends on the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+ in a biphasic manner: activated with the increase in Ca2+ up to approximately 300 nM and inhibited by its further increase. Kinetic studies of the Ca2+ release with rapid increase in Ca2+ or InsP3 using respective caged compounds indicated that the effects of Ca2+ appear immediately upon change in the Ca2+ concentration. Recovery from the Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition seemed also rapid after reduction in the Ca2+ concentration. These results indicate that there is a Ca(2+)-mediated positive feedback control of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release below 300 nM Ca2+. This feedback control seems to explain, at least partly, the phenomenon that InsP3 is more effective in the Ca2+ stores with greater Ca2+ loading. The Ca(2+)-mediated feedback control is also expected to give rise to temporally or spatially confined Ca2+ release as well as Ca2+ wave within the cells.},

	Abstract = {1. Calcium liberation induced in Xenopus oocytes by flash photorelease of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) from a caged precursor was monitored by confocal microfluorimetry. The object was to determine whether inhibition of Ca2+ release seen with paired flashes arose as a direct consequence of elevated cytosolic free [Ca2+]. 2. Responses evoked by just-suprathreshold test flashes were not inhibited by subthreshold conditioning flashes, but were strongly suppressed when conditioning flashes were raised above threshold. 3. Inhibition at first increased progressively as the inter-flash interval was lengthened to about 2 s and thereafter declined, with a half-recovery at about 4 s. 4. Intracellular injections of Ca2+ caused relatively slight inhibition of InsP3-evoked signals, even when cytosolic free [Ca2+] was elevated to levels similar to those at which strong inhibition was seen in paired-flash experiments. 5. Recovery from inhibition was not appreciably slowed when Ca2+ was injected to raise the free Ca2+ level between paired flashes. 6. We conclude that inhibition of InsP3-evoked Ca2+ liberation is not directly proportional to cytosolic free Ca2+ level and that recovery from inhibition in paired-pulse experiments involves factors other than the decline of cytosolic [Ca2+] following a conditioning response.},

	Abstract = {Quantal Ca2+ release is a novel motif for the mediation of signal transduction in which the amplitude of a biological response following multiple stepwise increases in agonist concentration is retained. The release of Ca2+ from permeabilized cells in response to the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) proceeds in this fashion. The mechanisms leading to quantal Ca2+ release are unknown. InsP3 releases 50-90% of the Ca2+ sequestered within the intracellular stores of mammalian cells permeabilized with saponin. However, preparation of microsomes results in the loss of this sensitivity. In this report, functionally intact intracellular Ca2+ stores were isolated from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells by osmotic lysis followed by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. From this preparation, 64% of the stored Ca2+ is released by InsP3. We demonstrate that quantal Ca2+ release is retained by isolated Ca2+ stores and is identical to that observed in permeabilized cells. Addition of a subsaturating (28 nM) concentration of InsP3 to permeabilized cells at 37 degrees C results in the release of only a small fraction of the sequestered Ca2+. When the cells are cooled to 11 degrees C, the remaining Ca2+ is rapidly released. Hence, the mechanism leading to the quantal nature of Ca2+ release is reversible and is thus not likely to be the result of a covalent modification of the channel protein or of the Ca2+ store.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

These receptors are typically distributed in clusters with several or tens of channels. The random opening and closing of these channels introduces stochasticity into the elementary calcium release mechanism. Stochastic release events have been experimentally observed in a variety of cell types and have been termed sparks and puffs. We put forward a stochastic version of the Li-Rinzel model (the deactivation binding process is described by a Markovian scheme) and a computationally more efficient Langevin approach to model the stochastic Ca(2+) oscillation of single clusters. Statistical properties such as Ca(2+) puff amplitudes, lifetimes, and interpuff intervals are studied with both models and compared with experimental observations. For clusters with tens of channels, a simply decaying amplitude distribution is typically observed at low IP(3) concentration, while a single peak distribution appears at high IP(3) concentration.},

	Abstract = {Stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells with acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin (CCK) results in an elevation of cytosolic calcium ([Ca(2+)](c)) through activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)R). The global temporal pattern of the [Ca(2+)](c) changes produced by ACh or CCK stimulation differs significantly. The hypothesis was tested that CCK stimulation results in a protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of InsP(3)R and this event contributes to the generation of agonist-specific [Ca(2+)](c) signals. Physiological concentrations of CCK evoked phosphorylation of the type III InsP(3)R, which was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PKA. Imaging of fura-2-loaded acinar cells revealed that the rate of [Ca(2+)](c) rise during CCK-evoked oscillations slows with each subsequent oscillation, consistent with a developing modulation of release, whereas the kinetics of ACh-evoked oscillations remain constant. Stimulation of cells with ACh following activation of PKA resulted in a slowing of the ACh-evoked [Ca(2+)](c) rise, which now resembled a time-matched CCK response. PKA activation also resulted in a slowing of [Ca(2+)](c) increases elicited by photolysis of caged InsP(3). Targeted, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of type III InsP(3)R is involved in a physiological CCK response, as disruption of the targeting of PKA with the peptide HT31 resulted in marked changes in the CCK-evoked [Ca(2+)](c) signal but had no effect on ACh-evoked responses. Stimulation of cells with bombesin, which evokes [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations indistinguishable from those produced by CCK, also results in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of type III InsP(3)R. Thus, we conclude that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of type III InsP(3)R is a general mechanism by which the patterns of [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations are shaped in pancreatic acinar cells.},

	Abstract = {There are three subtypes of mammalian Ins(1,4,5)P(3) (InsP(3)) receptor, each of which forms an intracellular Ca(2+) channel. Biphasic regulation of InsP(3) receptors by cytosolic Ca(2+) is well documented in cells expressing predominantly type 1 or type 2 InsP(3) receptors and might contribute to the regenerative recruitment of Ca(2+) release events and to limiting their duration in intact cells. The properties of type 3 receptors are less clear. Bilayer recording from InsP(3) receptors of RIN-5F cells, cells in which the InsP(3) receptors are likely to be largely type 3, recently suggested that the receptors are not inhibited by Ca(2+) [Hagar, Burgstahler, Nathanson and Ehrlich (1998) Nature (London) 296, 81-84]. By using antipeptide antisera that either selectively recognized each InsP(3) receptor subtype or interacted equally well with all subtypes, together with membranes from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing only single receptor subtypes to calibrate the immunoblotting, we quantified the relative levels of expression of type 1 (17%) and type 3 (77%) InsP(3) receptors in RINm5F cells. In unidirectional (45)Ca(2+) efflux experiments from permeabilized RINm5F cells, submaximal concentrations of InsP(3) released only a fraction of the InsP(3)-sensitive Ca(2+) stores, indicating that responses to InsP(3) are quantal. Increasing the cytosolic free [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](i)) from approx. 4 to 186 nM increased the sensitivity of the Ca(2+) stores to InsP(3): the EC(50) decreased from 281+/-15 to 82+/-2 nM. Further increases in [Ca(2+)](i) massively decreased the sensitivity of the stores to InsP(3), by almost 10-fold when [Ca(2+)](i) was 2.4 microM, and by more than 3000-fold when it was 100 microM. The inhibition caused by 100 microM Ca(2+) was fully reversed within 60 s of the restoration of [Ca(2+)](i) to 186 nM. The effect of submaximal InsP(3) concentrations on Ca(2+) mobilization from permeabilized RINm5F cells is therefore biphasically regulated by cytosolic Ca(2+). We conclude that type 3 InsP(3) receptors of RINm5F cells mediate quantal Ca(2+) release and they are biphasically regulated by cytosolic Ca(2+), either because a single type 1 subunit within the tetrameric receptor confers the Ca(2+) inhibition or because the type 3 subtype is itself directly inhibited by Ca(2+).},

	Abstract = {In cytosol-like medium (CLM) with a free [Ca(2+)] of 200 nm, a supramaximal concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) (30 microm) evoked (45)Ca(2+) release from type 3 IP(3) receptors only after a latency of 48 +/- 6 ms; this latency could not be reduced by increasing the IP(3) concentration. In CLM containing a low free [Ca(2+)] ( approximately 4 nm), 300 microm IP(3) evoked (45)Ca(2+) release after a latency of 66 +/- 11 ms; this was reduced to 14 +/- 3 ms when the [Ca(2+)] was 1 mm. Preincubation with CLM containing 100 microm Ca(2+) caused a rapid (half-time = 33 +/- 9 ms), complete, and fully reversible inhibition that could not be overcome by a high concentration of IP(3) (300 microm). Hepatic (type 2) IP(3) receptors were not inhibited by Ca(2+) once they had bound IP(3), but 100 microm Ca(2+) rapidly inhibited type 3 IP(3) receptors whether it was delivered before addition of IP(3) or at any stage during a response to IP(3). Ca(2+) increases the affinity of IP(3) for hepatic receptors by slowing IP(3) dissociation, but Ca(2+) had no effect on IP(3) binding to type 3 receptors. The rate of inhibition of type 3 IP(3) receptors by Ca(2+) was faster than the rate of IP(3) dissociation, and occurred at similar rates whether receptors had bound a high (adenophostin) or low affinity (3-deoxy-3-fluoro-IP(3)) agonist. Dissociation of agonist is not therefore required for Ca(2+) to inhibit type 3 IP(3) receptors. We conclude that type 2 and 3 IP(3) receptors are each biphasically regulated by Ca(2+), but by different mechanisms. For both, IP(3) binding causes a stimulatory Ca(2+)-binding site to be exposed allowing Ca(2+) to bind and open the channel. IP(3) binding protects type 2 receptors from Ca(2+) inhibition, but type 3 receptors are inhibited by Ca(2+) whether or not they have IP(3) bound. Increases in cytosolic [Ca(2+)] will immediately inhibit type 3 receptors, but inhibit type 2 receptors only after IP(3) has dissociated.},

	Abstract = {Confocal microscope studies with fluorescent dyes of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization recently established the existence of 'elementary' events, dependent on the activity of individual InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels. In the present work, we try by theoretical stochastic simulation to explain the smallest signals observed in those studies, which were referred to as Ca2+ 'blips' [Parker I., Yao Y. Ca2+ transients associated with openings of inositol trisphosphate-gated channels in Xenopus oocytes. J Physiol Lond 1996; 491: 663-668]. For this purpose, we assumed a simple molecular model for the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ channel and defined a set of parameter values accounting for the results obtained in electrophysiological bilayer experiments [Bezprozvanny I., Watras J., Ehrlich B.E. Bell-shaped calcium-response curves of Ins(1,4,5)P3- and calcium-gated channels from endoplasmic reticulum of cerebellum. Nature 1991; 351: 751-754; Bezprozvanny I., Ehrlich B.E. Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated Ca channels from cerebellum: conduction properties for divalent cations and regulation by intraluminal calcium. J Gen Physiol 1994; 104: 821-856]. With a stochastic procedure which considered cytosolic Ca2+ diffusion explicitly, we then simulated the behaviour of a single channel, placed in a realistic physiological environment. An attractive result was that the simulated channel exhibited bursts of activity, arising from repetitive channel openings, which were responsible for transient rises in Ca2+ concentration and were reminiscent of the relatively long-duration experimental Ca2+ blips. The influence of the values chosen for the various parameters (affinity and diffusion coefficient of the buffers, luminal Ca2+ concentration) on the kinetic characteristics of these theoretical blips is analyzed.},

	Abstract = {A remarkable property of Ca2+ fluxes through the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated Ca2+ channel is that successive increments of InsP3 induce repeated transient release of accumulated Ca2+. The initial aim of this study was to propose a model, based on hypotheses compatible with the current description of this Ca2+ channel, which could account for such experimental observations. The key feature of the model was the assumption that the Ca(2+)-binding sites on the receptor, whose occupancy leads to immediate channel activation but to subsequent slow channel desensitization, were located somewhere along the permeation pathway and were therefore sensitive to the flux of Ca2+ rather than the cytosolic or luminal Ca2+ concentration per se. Simulation showed that, provided Ca2+ bound to both activating and inhibitory sites with adequate cooperativity, addition of submaximal concentrations InsP3 resulted in transient opening well above the stationary state. The model also rationalized the documented existence of a threshold for InsP3 action, the puzzling control of channel sensitivity to InsP3 by luminal and cytosolic Ca2+, as well as the functional heterogeneity of the Ca2+ pools.},

	Abstract = {In the cytoplasm of cells of different types, discrete clusters of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca(2+) channels generate Ca(2+) signals of graded size, ranging from blips, which involve the opening of only one channel, to moderately larger puffs, which result from the concerted opening of a few channels in the same cluster. These channel clusters are of unknown size or geometrical characteristics. The aim of this study was to estimate the number of channels and the interchannel distance within such a cluster. Because these characteristics are not attainable experimentally, we performed computer stochastic simulations of Ca(2+) release events. We conclude that, to ensure efficient interchannel communication, as experimentally observed, a typical cluster should contain two or three tens of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca(2+) channels in close contact.},

	Abstract = {The three subtypes of inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor expressed in mammalian cells are each capable of forming intracellular Ca2+ channels that are regulated by both InsP3 and cytosolic Ca2+. The InsP3 receptors of many, though perhaps not all, tissues are biphasically regulated by cytosolic Ca2+: a rapid stimulation of the receptors by modest increases in Ca2+ concentration is followed by a slower inhibition at higher Ca2+ concentrations. Despite the widespread occurrence of this form of regulation and the belief that it is an important element of the mechanisms responsible for the complex Ca2+ signals evoked by physiological stimuli, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Both accessory proteins and Ca2+-binding sites on InsP3 receptors themselves have been proposed to mediate the effects of cytosolic Ca2+ on InsP3 receptor function, but the evidence is equivocal. The effects of cytosolic Ca2+ on InsP3 binding and channel opening, and the possible means whereby the effects are mediated are discussed in this review.},

	Abstract = {An explanation of the complex effects of hormones on intracellular Ca2+ requires that the intracellular actions of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the relationships between intracellular Ca2+ stores are fully understood. We have examined the kinetics of 45Ca2+ efflux from pre-loaded intracellular stores after stimulation with Ins(1,4,5)P3 or the stable phosphorothioate analogue, Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3, by simultaneous addition of one of them with glucose/hexokinase to rapidly deplete the medium of ATP. Under these conditions, a maximal concentration of either Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3 evoked rapid efflux of about half of the accumulated 45Ca2+, and thereafter the efflux was the same as occurred under control conditions. Submaximal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3 caused a smaller rapid initial efflux of 45Ca2+, after which the efflux was similar whatever the concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3 present. The failure of submaximal concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,4,5)P3[S]3 to mobilize fully the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ stores despite prolonged incubation was not due either to inactivation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or to desensitization of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. The results suggest that the size of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitive Ca2+ stores depends upon the concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3.},

	Abstract = {Streptolysin O-permeabilized pancreatic acini were used to study compartmentalization of Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ pools. In these cells, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ channels could be activated by a number of agonists (carbachol, cholecystokinin, or bombesin) or by activation of the entire cellular phospholipase C pool with GTP gamma S. Surprisingly, each of the antagonists interacting with acinar cells inactivated the channels after stimulation with GTP gamma S. In addition, when permeabilized cells were stimulated with more than one agonist, any antagonist to the specific agonists employed inactivated the channels. The aberrant behavior of the antagonists in permeable cells was not related to a loss of specificity since (a) when added before GTP gamma S, the antagonists had no effect on Ca2+ release and (b) when cells were stimulated with a single agonist, the antagonists prevented only the effect of their specific agonist. The differential behavior of the antagonists in intact and permeable cells suggests a compartmentalization of Ca2+ signaling into separate, agonist-specific units that is modified by cell permeabilization. Further evidence for compartmentalization of signaling was obtained by showing that the partial agonist (the CCK octapeptide analogue JMV-180) can access and release only 50% of the cholecystokinin- or IP3-mobilizable Ca2+ pool in intact and permeable cells. Kinetic measurements revealed a multiphasic time course of agonist-evoked Ca2+ release in permeable cells. At high agonist concentrations, all phases were fast and merged into an apparent single event of Ca2+ release. The phases were separated by three independent protocols: reduction in agonist concentrations, addition of heparin, or addition of guanosine-5'-O-(thio)diphosphate. Since all protocols that caused phase separation reduce IP3-mediated Ca2+ release, these findings demonstrate heterogeneity in the affinity for IP3 of channels present in compartmentalized Ca2+ pools of the same cells. Compartmentalization of signaling and the heterogeneity in the affinity for IP3 resulted in a quantal agonist-evoked Ca2+ release. The overall findings are discussed in the context of an integrated model of compartmentalization of signaling complexes, Ca2+ pools, and IP3-activated Ca2+ channels.},

	Abstract = {Generation of intracellular Ca2+ signals in response to Ca(2+)-mobilizing stimuli is a critical event in the control of many cellular processes. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) represents a dominant second messenger subserving the release of Ca2+ from intracellular store sites. The protein on the surface of which the IP3 receptor is located comprises an IP3-gated Ca2+ channel, and binding of IP3 to this receptor triggers the release of Ca2+ through this channel. The receptor for IP3 displays a close resemblance to the ryanodine receptor, another intracellular Ca2+ channel, in many molecular and physiological properties. Many lines of evidence strongly suggest the central role that the IP3 receptor plays in the conversion of numerous external stimuli to intracellular Ca2+ signals characterized by complex spatiotemporal patterns such as Ca2+ waves and oscillations. In this review, we shall summarize our current knowledge of the structure and function of the IP3 receptor in order to understand the way how the activity of this important receptor is regulated to accomodate itself to the generation of diverse intracellular Ca2+ signals.},

	Abstract = {The conduction properties of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated calcium (Ca) channels (InsP3R) from canine cerebellum for divalent cations and the regulation of the channels by intraluminal Ca were studied using channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. Analysis of single-channel recordings performed with different divalent cations present at 55 mM on the trans (intraluminal) side of the membrane revealed that the current amplitude at 0 mV and the single-channel slope conductance fell in the sequence: Ba (2.2 pA, 85 pS) > Sr (2.0 pA, 77 pS) > Ca (1.4 pA, 53 pS) > Mg (1.1 pA, 42 pS). The mean open time of the InsP3R recorded with Ca (2.9 ms) was significantly shorter than with other divalent cations (approximately 5.5 ms). The "anomalous mole fraction effect" was not observed in mixtures of divalent cations (Mg and Ba), suggesting that these channels are single-ion pores. Measurements of InsP3R activity at different intraluminal Ca levels demonstrated that Ca in the submillimolar range did not potentiate channel activity, and that very high levels of intraluminal Ca (> or = 10 mM) decreased channel open probability 5-10-fold. When InsP3R were measured with Ba as a current carrier in the presence of 110 mM cis potassium, a PBa/PK of 6.3 was estimated from the extrapolated value for the reversal potential. When the unitary current through the InsP3R at 0 mV was measured as a function of the permeant ion (Ba) concentration, the half-maximal current occurred at 10 mM trans Ba. The following conclusions are drawn from these data: (a) the conduction properties of InsP3R are similar to the properties of the ryanodine receptor, another intracellular Ca channel, and differ dramatically from the properties of voltage-gated Ca channels of the plasma membrane. (b) The estimated size of the Ca current through the InsP3R under physiological conditions is 0.5 pA, approximately four times less than the Ca current through the ryanodine receptor. (c) The potentiation of InsP3R by intraluminal Ca in the submillimolar range remains controversial. (d) A quantitative model that explains the inhibitory effects of high trans Ca on InsP3R activity was developed and the kinetic parameters of InsP3R gating were determined.},

The magnitude of the local release fluxes varied from 2 to 5 microM ms-1, depending on SR Ca2+ loading conditions. Following spontaneous activation, the release flux rapidly decayed (tau = 6-12 ms). The rate of termination of release flux was found to be directly related to the magnitude of the flux (r2 = 0.88). 4. The rate of termination of local release flux was slowed in the presence of FK506, a compound that is known to reduce inactivation of SR Ca2+ channels in vitro. 5. These results suggest that termination of release flux during sparks is not due to a spontaneous stochastic decay process or local depletion of Ca2+ from the SR, but rather involves an active extinguishing mechanism such as Ca2+-dependent inactivation or adaptation.},

	Abstract = {The modal gating behavior of single sheep cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-release/ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels was assessed. We find that the gating of RyR channels spontaneously shifts between high (H) and low (L) levels of activity and inactive periods where no channel openings are detected (I). Moreover, we find that there is evidence for multiple gating modes within H activity, which we term H1 and H2 mode. Our results demonstrate that the underlying mechanisms regulating gating are similar in native and purified channels. Dwell-time distributions of L activity were best fitted by three open and five closed significant exponential components whereas dwell-time distributions of H1 activity were best fitted by two to three open and four closed significant exponential components. Increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] cause an increase in open probability (Po) within L activity and an increase in the probability of occurrence of H activity. Open lifetime distributions within L activity were Ca2+ independent whereas open lifetime distributions within H activity were Ca2+ dependent. This study is the first attempt to estimate RyR single-channel kinetic parameters from sequences of idealized dwell-times and to develop kinetic models of RyR gating using the criterion of maximum likelihood. We propose distinct kinetic schemes for L, H1, and H2 activity that describe the major features of sheep cardiac RyR channel gating at these levels of activity.},

Ca2+ liberation induced in Xenopus oocytes by a poorly metabolized derivative of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; 3-F-InsP3) was visualized using a video-rate confocal microscope to image fluorescence signals reported by the indicator dye calcium green-1. 2. Low (10-30 nM) intracellular concentrations of 3-F-InsP3 evoked Ca2+ release as localized transient 'puffs'. Progressively higher concentrations (30-60 nM) gave rise to abortive Ca2+ waves triggered by puffs, and then (> 60 nM) to a sustained elevation of Ca2+ followed by the appearance of propagating Ca2+ waves. At concentrations up to that giving waves, the frequency of puffs increased as about the third power of [InsP3], whereas their amplitudes increased only slightly. 3. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ during a puff began abruptly, and peaked within about 50 ms. The peak free Ca2+ level was about 180 nM, and the total amount of Ca2+ liberated was several attomoles (10(-18) mol), too much to be accounted for by opening of a single InsP3-gated channel. The subsequent decline of Ca2+ occurred over a few hundred milliseconds, determined largely by diffusion of Ca2+ away from the release site, rather than by resequestration. Lateral spread of Ca2+ was restricted to a few micrometres, consistent with an effective diffusion coefficient for Ca2+ ions of about 27 microns2 s-1. 4. The peak amplitudes of puffs recorded at a given site were distributed in a roughly Gaussian manner, and a small proportion of sites consistently gave puffs much larger than the main population. Intervals between successive puffs at a single site were exponentially distributed, except for a progressive fall-off in puffs seen at intervals shorter than about 10 s. Thus, triggering of puffs appeared to be stochastically determined after recovery from a refractory period. 5. There was little correlation between the occurrence of puffs at sites more than a few micrometres apart, indicating that puff sites can function autonomously, but closely (ca 2 microns) adjacent sites showed highly correlated behaviour. 6. Puffs arose from sites-present at a density of about 1 per 30 microns2 in the animal hemisphere, located within a narrow band about 5-7 microns below the plasma membrane. 7. We conclude that Ca2+ puffs represent a 'quantal' unit of InsP3-evoked Ca2+ liberation, which may arise because local regenerative feedback by cytosolic Ca2+ ions causes the concerted opening of several closely clustered InsP3 receptor channels.},

The mechanisms underlying inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced Ca2+ liberation were studied in Xenopus oocytes by using scanning and stationary-point confocal fluorescence microscopy to record Ca2+ signals evoked by photorelease of InsP3 from a caged precursor. 2. Fluorescence measurements from confocal images showed that increasing [InsP3] evoked three distinct modes of Ca2+ liberation: a diffuse 'pacemaker' signal, localized transient puffs, and propagating waves. Peak free Ca2+ concentrations during waves and puffs (respectively, 2-5 microM and 100-200 nM) varied only slightly with [InsP3], whereas the pacemaker amplitude varied over a wider range (at least 1-30 nM Ca2+). 3. The improved resolution provided by confocal point recording revealed discontinuous Ca2+ 'blips' during pacemaker release. These events were resolved only at particular locations and had time courses similar to the puffs (rise, approximately 50 ms; decay, a few hundred milliseconds) but with amplitudes one-fifth or less of puff amplitudes. 4. We conclude that blips may arise through opening of single InsP3-gated channels, whereas puffs reflect the concerted opening of several clustered channels due to local regenerative feedback by Ca2+.},

	Abstract = {In striated muscles, intracellular Ca(2+) release is tightly controlled by the membrane voltage sensor. Ca(2+) ions are necessary mediators of this control in cardiac but not in skeletal muscle, where their role is ill-understood. An intrinsic gating oscillation of Ca(2+) release-not involving the voltage sensor-is demonstrated in frog skeletal muscle fibers under voltage clamp. A Markov model of the Ca(2+) release units is shown to reproduce the oscillations, and it is demonstrated that for Markov processes to have oscillatory transients, its transition rates must violate thermodynamic reversibility. Such irreversibility results in permanent cycling of the units through a ring of states, which requires a source of free energy. Inhibition of the oscillation by 20 to 40 mM EGTA or partial depletion of Ca(2+) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) identifies the SR [Ca(2+)] gradient as the energy source, and indicates a location of the critical Ca(2+)-sensing site at distances greater than 35 nm from the open channel. These results, which are consistent with a recent demonstration of irreversibility in gating of cardiac Ca(2+) sparks, (Wang, S.-Q., L.-S. Song, L. Xu, G. Meissner, E. G. Lakatta, E. Rios, M. D.

	Abstract = {For a single or a group of Markov channels gating reversibly, distributions of open and closed times should be the sum of positively weighted decaying exponentials. Violation of this microscopic reversibility has been demonstrated previously on a number of occasions at the single channel level, and has been attributed to possible channel coupling to external sources of free energy. Here we show that distribution of durations of Ca(2+) release underlying Ca(2+) sparks in intact cardiac myocytes exhibits a prominent mode at approximately 8 ms. Analysis of the cycle time for repetitive sparks at hyperactive sites revealed no intervals briefer than approximately 35 ms and a mode at approximately 90 ms. These results indicate that, regardless of whether Ca(2+) sparks are single-channel or multi-channel in origin, they are generated by thermodynamically irreversible stochastic processes. In contrast, data from planar lipid bilayer experiments were consistent with reversible gating of RyR under asymmetric cis (4 microM) and trans Ca(2+) (10 mM), suggesting that the irreversibility for Ca(2+) spark genesis may reside at a supramolecular level. Modeling suggests that Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release among adjacent RyRs may couple the external energy derived from Ca(2+) gradients across the SR to RyR gating in situ, and drive the irreversible generation of Ca(2+) sparks.},

	Abstract = {The purposes of the present study were to investigate the characteristics and regulation of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane in pancreatic acini and to demonstrate the role of this Ca2+ influx in the mechanism of reloading of the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool. In pancreatic acini, depleted of intracellular Ca2+ by stimulation with carbachol in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, 25 microM LaCl3 inhibited the increase in free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and reloading of the agonist-sensitive pool that occurred with the addition of extracellular CaCl2 to the medium. LaCl3 also inhibited the increase in cellular 45Ca2+ uptake that occurred during agonist stimulation and its termination but not cellular 45Ca2+ uptake into unstimulated acini. In acini depleted of intracellular Ca2+, increased cellular Ca2+ influx and reloading of the agonist-sensitive pool occurred even if extracellular CaCl2 was added 10 min after the termination of agonist action. Maximal reloading was independent of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration between 0.5 and 2.0 mM CaCl2. However, the time to maximal reloading was longer at lower extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. These results demonstrate a plasma membrane Ca2+ influx mechanism in the pancreatic acinar cell that is activated during cell stimulation. This transport remains activated as long as the agonist-sensitive pool is not completely loaded with Ca2+ suggesting that the Ca2+ influx mechanism is regulated by the quantity of Ca2+ in the agonist-sensitive pool. The activation of this Ca2+ transport mechanism functions to allow Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane and Ca2+ reloading of the agonist-sensitive pool. Furthermore, these results suggest that during reloading Ca2+ crosses the plasma membrane into the cytosol before entering the agonist-sensitive pool.},

	Abstract = {The Ca2(+)-mobilizing actions of the muscarinic receptor agonist, methacholine (MeCh), and the microsomal Ca2+ pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, were investigated in lacrimal acinar cells. As previously shown for parotid cells (J. Biol. Chem. 264: 12266-12271, 1989), thapsigargin activates both internal Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space without increasing cellular inositol phosphates. The inorganic Ca2+ antagonist La3+ inhibited MeCh- or thapsigargin-activated Ca2+ entry. However, when added before MeCh or thapsigargin, La3+ inhibited the extrusion of Ca2+ at the plasma membrane. This phenomenon was exploited in protocols designed to investigate the pathways for filling agonist-sensitive Ca2+ stores in lacrimal cells. The results show that, in contrast to previous suggestions that external Ca2+ is required to replenish agonist-regulated Ca2+ stores, the inhibition of Ca2+ extrusion permits recycling of Ca2+ released by MeCh back into an MeCh- and thapsigargin-sensitive pool. Thus, although extracellular Ca2+ is the major source for refilling the intracellular Ca2+ stores under physiological conditions, the pathway by which this Ca2+ enters the pool need not be a direct one. These results are consistent with the recently revised capacitative model for the refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores through Ca2+ influx subsequent to Ca2+ depletion, according to which refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores occurs via a cytoplasmic route rather than a direct channel between intracellular Ca2+ stores and the extracellular space.},

Fura-2 loaded cultured rat aortic myocytes were used with digital imaging to measure the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) and to monitor La3+ entry. At a La3+ concentration ([La3+]o) of 0.25 mM, but not at lower concentrations, La3+ entered the cells; 0.01 mM verapamil blocked this entry. Transient increases in [Ca2+]cyt were evoked by unloading the sarcoplasmic reticulum with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA)+caffeine (CAF) in Na,Ca-free medium (to inhibit Ca2+ extrusion via Na+/Ca2+ exchange and Ca2+ influx). La3+ (0.03-0.25 mM with verapamil) augmented the Ca2+ transients and slowed Nao-independent [Ca2+]cyt recovery in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 0.01 mM La3+). This La(3+)-sensitive recovery was apparently mediated by the PM Ca2+ pump. The effects of La3+ were reversible: [Ca2+]cyt returned promptly toward base line when La3+ was washed out in Na,Ca-free medium containing CPA + CAF. Reintroduction of extracellular Na+ during [Ca2+]cyt recovery ([La3+]o = 0.06-0.25 mM) significantly speeded recovery, indicating that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was not inhibited by [La3+]o < or = 0.25 mM. The La(3+)-sensitive (Nao-independent) and Nao-dependent [Ca2+]cyt recovery rates were comparable. In Na(+)-loaded cells, < or = 0.25 mM La3+ also did not affect Na+/Ca2+ exchange mediated Ca2+ influx. In medium containing Na+ and Ca2+, 0.125 mM La3+ abolished the serotonin (5-HT) evoked plateau responses that resulted from Ca2+ entry via Ca2+ channels. In Na,Ca-free medium, but not Ca-free medium, however, La3+ converted 5-HT evoked Ca2+ transients into sustained responses. We conclude that low [La3+]o (0.06-0.25 mM) inhibits the PM Ca2+ pump, but spares Na+/Ca2+ exchanger mediated Ca2+ influx and efflux in arterial myocytes.},

	Abstract = {Along with the inositol trisphosphate-induced release of stored Ca(2+), a receptor-enhanced entry of Ca(2+) is a critical component of intracellular Ca(2+) signals generated by agonists acting at receptors coupled to the activation of phospholipase C. Although the simple emptying of the intracellular Ca(2+) stores is known to be capable of activating Ca(2+) entry via the so-called "capacitative" mechanism, recent evidence suggests that Ca(2+) entry at physiological agonist concentrations, where oscillatory Ca(2+) signals are typically observed, does not conform to such a model. Instead, a noncapacitative Ca(2+) entry pathway regulated by arachidonic acid appears to be responsible for Ca(2+) entry under these conditions. Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques we demonstrate that low concentrations of arachidonic acid activate a Ca(2+)-selective current that is superficially similar to the store-operated current I(CRAC), but which also demonstrates certain distinct features. We have named this novel current I(ARC) (for arachidonate-regulated calcium current). Importantly, I(ARC) can be readily activated in cells whose Ca(2+) stores have been maximally depleted. I(ARC) represents a novel Ca(2+) entry pathway that is entirely separate from those activated by store depletion and is specifically activated at physiological levels of stimulation.},

	Abstract = {The InsP3R Ca2+ release channel has a biphasic dependence on cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). InsP3 activates gating primarily by reducing the sensitivity of the channel to inhibition by high [Ca2+]i. To determine if relieving Ca2+ inhibition is sufficient for channel activation, we examined single-channel activities in low [Ca2+]i in the absence of InsP3, by patch clamping isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei. For both endogenous Xenopus type 1 and recombinant rat type 3 InsP3R channels, spontaneous InsP3-independent channel activities with low open probability Po ( approximately 0.03) were observed in [Ca2+]i < 5 nM with the same frequency as in the presence of InsP3, whereas no activities were observed in 25 nM Ca2+. These results establish the half-maximal inhibitory [Ca2+]i of the channel to be 1.2-4.0 nM in the absence of InsP3, and demonstrate that the channel can be active when all of its ligand-binding sites (including InsP3) are unoccupied. In the simplest allosteric model that fits all observations in nuclear patch-clamp studies of [Ca2+]i and InsP3 regulation of steady-state channel gating behavior of types 1 and 3 InsP3R isoforms, including spontaneous InsP3-independent channel activities, the tetrameric channel can adopt six different conformations, the equilibria among which are controlled by two inhibitory and one activating Ca2+-binding and one InsP3-binding sites in a manner outlined in the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. InsP3 binding activates gating by affecting the Ca2+ affinities of the high-affinity inhibitory sites in different conformations, transforming it into an activating site. Ca2+ inhibition of InsP3-liganded channels is mediated by an InsP3-independent low-affinity inhibitory site. The model also suggests that besides the ligand-regulated gating mechanism, the channel has a ligand-independent gating mechanism responsible for maximum channel Po being less than unity. The validity of this model was established by its successful quantitative prediction of channel behavior after it had been exposed to ultra-low bath [Ca2+].},

Pancreatic acinar cells are a classic model for the study of CCK- and ACh-evoked specific Ca2+ signals. In addition to inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3), recent studies have shown that cyclic ADPribose (cADPr) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) release Ca2+ in pancreatic acinar cells. Moreover, it has also been shown that both ACh and CCK trigger Ca2+ spikes by co-activation of IP3 and ryanodine receptors but by different means. ACh uses IP3 and Ca2+, whereas CCK uses cADPr and NAADP. In addition, CCK activates phospholipase A2 and D.

	Abstract = {Receptor-activated Ca(2+) entry is usually thought to occur via capacitative or store-operated Ca(2+) channels. However, at physiological levels of stimulation, where Ca(2+) store depletion is only transient and/or partial, evidence has suggested that an arachidonic acid-dependent noncapacitative Ca(2+) entry is responsible. Recently, we have described a novel arachidonate-regulated Ca(2+)-selective (ARC) conductance that is entirely distinct from store-operated conductances in the same cell. We now show that these ARC channels are indeed specifically activated by low agonist concentrations and provide the predominant route of Ca(2+) entry under these conditions. We further demonstrate that sustained elevations in cytosolic Ca(2+), such as those resulting from activation of store-operated Ca(2+) entry by high agonist concentrations, inhibit the ARC channels. This explains earlier failures to detect the presence of this noncapacitative pathway in experiments where store-operated entry had already been fully activated. The result is that the respective activities of ARC and store-operated Ca(2+) channels display a unique reciprocal regulation that is related to the specific nature of the [Ca(2+)](i) signals generated at different agonist concentrations. Importantly, these data show that at physiologically relevant levels of stimulation, it is the noncapacitative ARC channels that provide the predominant route for the agonist-activated entry of Ca(2+).},

	Abstract = {Recent evidence underlines a key role of mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes in cell Ca2+ signalling. We present here a kinetic model simulating the Ca2+ fluxes generated by mitochondria during mitochondrial Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (mCICR) resulting from the operation of the permeability transition pore (PTP). Our model connects the Ca2+ fluxes through the ruthenium redsensitive Ca2+ uniporter, the respiration-dependent and passive H+ fluxes, the rate of oxygen consumption, the movements of weak acids across the mitochondrial membrane, the electrical transmembrane potential (delta psi), and operation of the PTP. We find that two factors are crucial to account for the various mCICR profiles that can be observed experimentally: (i) the dependence of PTP opening and closure on matrix pH (pHi), and (ii) the relative inhibition of the respiratory rate consecutive to PTP opening. The resulting model can simulate irreversible Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria, as well as the genesis of damped or sustained Ca2+ oscillations, and of single Ca2+ spikes. The model also simulates the main features of mCICR, i.e. the threshold-dependence of mCICR triggering, and the all-or-nothing nature of mCICR operation. Our model should appear useful to further mathematically address the consequences of mCICR on the spatiotemporal organisation of Ca2+ signals, as a 'plug-in' module for the existing models of cell Ca2+ signalling.},

Simple plausible rate laws for Ca(2+) fluxes across the inner mitochondrial membrane have been used in this model. Here we show that it is possible to use the same rate laws as a plug-in element in other existing mathematical models and obtain the same effect on amplitude regulation. This result appears to be universal, independent of the type of model and the type of Ca(2+) oscillations. We demonstrate this on two models for spiking Ca(2+) oscillations [J. Biol.

	Abstract = {Intercellular regenerative calcium waves in systems such as the liver and the blowfly salivary gland have been hypothesized to spread through calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and gap-junctional calcium diffusion. A simple mathematical model of this mechanism is developed. It includes CICR and calcium removal from the cytoplasm, cytoplasmic and gap-junctional calcium diffusion, and calcium buffering. For a piecewise linear approximation of the calcium kinetics, expressions in terms of the cellular parameters are derived for 1) the condition for the propagation of intercellular waves, and 2) the characteristic time of the delay of a wave encountered at the gap junctions. Intercellular propagation relies on the local excitation of CICR in the perijunctional space by gap-junctional calcium influx. This mechanism is compatible with low effective calcium diffusivity, and necessitates that CICR can be excited in every cell along the path of a wave. The gap-junctional calcium permeability required for intercellular waves in the model falls in the range of reported gap-junctional permeability values. The concentration of diffusive cytoplasmic calcium buffers and the maximal rate of CICR, in the case of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor calcium release channels set by the IP(3) concentration, are shown to be further determinants of wave behavior.},

	Abstract = {Hepatocytes respond with repetitive cytosolic calcium spikes to stimulation by vasopressin and noradrenalin. In the intact liver, calcium oscillations occur in a synchronized fashion as periodic waves across whole liver lobules, but the mechanism of intercellular coupling remains unclear. Recently, it has been shown that individual hepatocytes can have very different intrinsic oscillation frequencies but become phase-locked when coupled by gap junctions. We investigate the gap junction hypothesis for intercellular synchronization by means of a mathematical model. It is shown that junctional calcium fluxes are effective in synchronizing calcium oscillations in coupled hepatocytes. An experimentally testable estimate is given for the junctional coupling coefficient required; it mainly depends on the degree of heterogeneity between cells. Intercellular synchronization by junctional calcium diffusion may occur also in other cell types exhibiting calcium-activated calcium release through InsP(3) receptors, if the gap junctional coupling is strong enough and the InsP(3) receptors are sufficiently sensitized by InsP(3).},

	Abstract = {The proper working of the liver largely depends on the fine tuning of the level of cytosolic Ca(2+) in hepatocytes. Thanks to the development of imaging techniques, our understanding of the spatio-temporal organization of intracellular Ca(2+) in this - and other - cell types has much improved. Many of these signals are mediated by a rise in the level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)), a second messenger which can activate the release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum. Besides the now well-known hepatic Ca(2+) oscillations induced by hormonal stimulation, intra- and intercellular Ca(2+) waves have also been observed. More recently, subcellular Ca(2+) increases associated with the coordinated opening of a few Ca(2+) channels have been reported. Given the complexity of the regulations involved in the generation of such processes and the variety of time and length scales necessary to describe those phenomena, theoretical models have been largely used to gain a precise and quantitative understanding of the dynamics of intracellular Ca(2+). Here, we review the various aspects of the spatio-temporal organization of cytosolic Ca(2+) in hepatocytes from the dual point of view provided by experiments and modeling. We first focus on the description and the mechanism of intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations and waves. Second, we investigate in which manner these repetitive Ca(2+) increases are coordinated among a set of hepatocytes coupled by gap junctions, a phenomenon known as 'intercellular Ca(2+) waves'. Finally, we focus on the so-called elementary Ca(2+) signals induced by low InsP(3) concentrations, leading to Ca(2+) rises having a spatial extent of a few microns. Although these small-scale events have been mainly studied in other cell types, we theoretically infer general properties of these localized intracellular Ca(2+) rises that could also apply to hepatocytes.},

	Abstract = {Our understanding of the nature and regulation of receptor-activated Ca(2+) entry in nonexcitable cells has recently undergone a radical change that began with the identification of the stromal interacting molecule proteins (e.g., STIM1) as playing a critical role in the regulation of the capacitative, or store-operated, Ca(2+) entry. As such, current models emphasize the role of STIM1 located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it senses the status of the intracellular Ca(2+) stores via a luminal N-terminal Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand domain. Dissociation of Ca(2+) from this domain induces the clustering of STIM1 to regions of the ER that lie close to the plasma membrane, where it regulates the activity of the store-operated Ca(2+) channels (e.g., CRAC channels). Thus, the specific dependence on store-depletion, and the role of the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand domain in this process, are critical to all current models of the action of STIM1 on Ca(2+) entry. However, until recently, the effects of STIM1 on other modes of receptor-activated Ca(2+) entry have not been examined. Surprisingly, we found that STIM1 exerts similar, although not identical, actions on the arachidonic acid-regulated Ca(2+)-selective (ARC) channels-a widely expressed mode of agonist-activated Ca(2+) entry whose activation is completely independent of Ca(2+) store depletion. Regulation of the ARC channels by STIM1 is not only independent of store depletion, but also of the Ca(2+)-binding function of the EF-hand, and translocation of STIM1 to the plasma membrane. Instead, it is the pool of STIM1 that constitutively resides in the plasma membrane that is critical for the regulation of the ARC channels. Thus, ARC channel activity is selectively inhibited by exposure of intact cells to an antibody targeting the extracellular N-terminal domain of STIM1. Similarly, introducing mutations in STIM1 that prevent the N-linked glycosylation-dependent constitutive expression of the protein in the plasma membrane specifically inhibits the activity of the ARC channels without affecting the CRAC channels. These studies demonstrate that STIM1 is a far more universal regulator of Ca(2+) entry pathways than previously assumed, and has multiple, and entirely distinct, modes of action. Precisely how this same protein can act in such separate and specific ways on these different pathways of agonist-activated Ca(2+)entry remains an intriguing, yet currently unresolved, question.},

	Abstract = {The universality of Ca(2+) as second messenger in living cells is achieved by a rich spectrum of spatiotemporal cellular concentration dynamics. Ca(2+) release from internal storage compartments plays a key role in shaping cytosolic Ca(2+) signals. Deciphering this signaling mechanism is essential for a deeper understanding of its physiological function and general concepts of cell signaling. Here, we review recent experimental findings demonstrating the stochasticity of Ca(2+) oscillations and its relevance for modeling Ca(2+) dynamics. The stochasticity arises by the hierarchical signal structure that carries molecular fluctuations of single channels onto the level of the cell leading to a stochastic medium as theoretically predicted. The result contradicts the current opinion of Ca(2+) being a cellular oscillator. We demonstrate that cells use array enhanced coherence resonance to form rather regular spiking signals and that the "oscillations" carry information despite the involved stochasticity. The knowledge on the underlying mechanism also allows for determination of intrinsic properties from global observations. In the second part of the paper, we briefly survey different modeling approaches with regard to the experimental results. We focus on the dependence of the standard deviation on the mean period of the oscillations. It shows that limit cycle oscillations cannot describe the experimental data and that generic models have to include the spatial aspects of Ca(2+) signaling.},

Many cell stimuli act on receptors that are coupled to phospholipase C that hydrolyses phosphatidylinosol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to release IP3 to the cytosol. IP3 receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum respond to this elevation of IP3 by releasing Ca2+, which is often organized into characteristic spatial (elementary events and waves) and temporal (Ca2+ oscillations) patterns. This IP3/Ca2+ pathway is a remarkably versatile signalling system that has been adapted to control processes as diverse as fertilization, proliferation, contraction, cell metabolism, vesicle and fluid secretion and information processing in neuronal cells.},

	Abstract = {Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) was first discovered in skeletal muscle. CICR is defined as Ca2+ release by the action of Ca2+ alone without the simultaneous action of other activating processes. CICR is biphasically dependent on Ca2+ concentration; is inhibited by Mg2+, procaine, and tetracaine; and is potentiated by ATP, other adenine compounds, and caffeine. With depolarization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a potential change of the SR membrane in which the luminal side becomes more negative, CICR is activated for several seconds and is then inactivated. All three types of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) show CICR activity. At least one RyR, RyR1, also shows non-CICR Ca2+ release, such as that triggered by the t-tubule voltage sensor, by clofibric acid, and by SR depolarization. Maximum rates of CICR, at the optimal Ca2+ concentration in the presence of physiological levels of ATP and Mg2+ determined in skinned fibers and fragmented SR, are much lower than the rate of physiological Ca2+ release. The primary event of physiological Ca2+ release, the Ca2+ spark, is the simultaneous opening of multiple channels, the coordinating mechanism of which does not appear to be CICR because of the low probability of CICR opening under physiological conditions. The coordination may require Ca2+, but in that case, some other stimulus or stimuli must be provided simultaneously, which is not CICR by definition. Thus CICR does not appear to contribute significantly to physiological Ca2+ release. On the other hand, CICR appears to play a key role in caffeine contracture and malignant hyperthermia. The potentiation of voltage-activated Ca2+ release by caffeine, however, does not seem to occur through secondary CICR, although the site where caffeine potentiates voltage-activated Ca2+ release might be the same site where caffeine potentiates CICR.},

	Abstract = {The secretion of fluid, electrolytes, and protein by exocrine gland acinar cells is a vectorial process that requires the coordinated regulation of multiple channel and transporter proteins, signaling components, as well as mechanisms involved in vesicular fusion and water transport. Most critical in this is the regulation of cytosolic free [Ca(2)(+)] ([Ca(2)(+)](i)) in response to neurotransmitter stimulation. Control of [Ca(2)(+)](i) increase in specific regions of the cell is the main determinant of fluid and electrolyte secretion in salivary gland acinar cells as it regulates several major ion flux mechanisms as well as the water channel that are required for this process. Polarized [Ca(2)(+)](i) signals are also essential for protein secretion in pancreatic acinar cells. Thus, the mechanisms that generate and modulate these compartmentalized [Ca(2)(+)](i) signals are central to the regulation of exocrine secretion. These mechanisms include membrane receptors for neurotransmitters, intracellular Ca(2)(+) release channels, Ca(2)(+) entry channels, as well Ca(2)(+) as pumps and mitochondria. The spatial arrangement of proteins involved in Ca(2)(+) signaling is of primary significance in the generation of specific compartmentalized [Ca(2)(+)](i) signals. Within these domains, both local and global [Ca(2)(+)](i) changes are tightly controlled. Control of secretion is also dependent on the targeting of ion channels and transporters to specific domains in the cell where their regulation by [Ca(2)(+)](i) signals is facilitated. Together, the polarized localization of Ca(2)(+) signaling and secretory components drive vectorial secretion of fluid, electrolytes, and proteins in the exocrine salivary glands and pancreas. This review will discuss recent findings which have led to resolution of the molecular components underlying the spatio-temporal control of [Ca(2)(+)](i) signals in exocrine gland cells and their role in secretion.},

The apical regions of clusters of coupled acinar cells collectively form a lumen which constitutes the blind end of a tube created by ductal cells - a structure reminiscent of a "bunch of grapes". When activated by neural or hormonal secretagogues, pancreatic acinar cells are stimulated to secrete a variety of proteins. These proteins are predominately inactive digestive enzyme precursors called "zymogens". Acinar cell secretion is absolutely dependent on secretagogue-induced increases in intracellular free Ca(2+). The increase in [Ca(2+)](i) has precise temporal and spatial characteristics as a result of the exquisite regulation of the proteins responsible for Ca(2+) release, Ca(2+) influx and Ca(2+) clearance in the acinar cell.

	Abstract = {We present what we believe to be a new mathematical model of Ca(2+) leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the heart. To our knowledge, it is the first to incorporate a realistic number of Ca(2+)-release units, each containing a cluster of stochastically gating Ca(2+) channels (RyRs), whose biophysical properties (e.g., Ca(2+) sensitivity and allosteric interactions) are informed by the latest molecular investigations. This realistic model allows for the detailed characterization of RyR Ca(2+)-release properties, and shows how this balances reuptake by the SR Ca(2+) pump. Simulations reveal that SR Ca(2+) leak consists of brief but frequent single RyR openings (~3000 cell(-1) s(-1)) that are likely to be experimentally undetectable, and are, therefore, "invisible". We also observe that these single RyR openings can recruit additional RyRs to open, due to elevated local (Ca(2+)), and occasionally lead to the generation of Ca(2+) sparks (~130 cell(-1) s(-1)). Furthermore, this physiological formulation of "invisible" leak allows for the removal of the ad hoc, non-RyR mediated Ca(2+) leak terms present in prior models. Finally, our model shows how Ca(2+) sparks can be robustly triggered and terminated under both normal and pathological conditions. Together, these discoveries profoundly influence how we interpret and understand diverse experimental and clinical results from both normal and diseased hearts.},

J. 334, 447-455], and Ca(2+) mobilization by type-1 InsP(3) receptors of cerebellum is inhibited by calmodulin [Patel, Morris, Adkins, O&apos;Beirne and Taylor (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 11627-11632]. Using cell types expressing predominantly type-1, -2 or -3 InsP(3) receptors, we show that InsP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) mobilization from each is similarly inhibited by calmodulin. In SH-SY5Y cells, which express largely type-1 receptors, calmodulin (IC(50) approximately 15 microM) inhibited InsP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) release only in the presence of Ca(2+). The inhibition was unaffected by calcineurin inhibitors. The effect of calmodulin did not result from enhanced metabolism of InsP(3) because calmodulin also decreased the sensitivity of the Ca(2+) stores to adenophostin A, a non-metabolizable InsP(3)-receptor agonist. Protein kinase A-catalysed phosphorylation of type-1 InsP(3) receptors was unaffected by Ca(2+)-calmodulin. Using a scintillation proximity assay to measure (125)I-calmodulin binding to glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins, we identified two regions of the type-1 InsP(3) receptor (cyt1, residues -6 to 159; and cyt11, residues 1499-1649) that bound (125)I-calmodulin. The higher-affinity site (cyt11) was also photoaffinity labelled with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate (HSAB)-calmodulin. We speculate that Ca(2+)-independent binding of calmodulin to a site within the first 159 residues of the type-1 InsP(3) receptor inhibits InsP(3) binding and may thereby regulate the kinetics of Ca(2+) release. Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of Ca(2+) release by calmodulin is mediated by a different site: it may reside on an accessory protein that associates with all three receptor subtypes, or Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding to a site lying between residues 1499 and 1649 of the type-1 receptor may inhibit Ca(2+) release from any tetrameric receptor that includes a type-1 subunit.},

The concentration of adenophostin A causing the half-maximal effect (EC(50)) was 7.1+/-0.5 nM, whereas the EC(50) for InsP(3) was 177+/-26 nM; both responses were positively co-operative. In rapid superfusion analyses of (45)Ca(2+) release from the intracellular stores of immobilized hepatocytes, maximal concentrations of adenophostin A or InsP(3) evoked indistinguishable patterns of Ca(2+) release. The Ca(2+) release evoked by both agonists peaked at the same maximal rate after about 375 ms and the activity of the receptors then decayed to a stable, partially (60%) inactivated state with a half-time (t(1/2)) of 318+/-29 ms for adenophostin A and 321+/-22 ms for InsP(3). Dissociation rates were measured by recording rates of InsP(3)-receptor channel closure after rapid removal of agonist.

We conclude that slow dissociation of adenophostin A from InsP(3) receptors does not underlie either its high-affinity binding or the reported differences in the Ca(2+) signals evoked by InsP(3) and adenophostin A in intact cells.},

	Abstract = {Long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) in excitatory synapses can coexist, the former being triggered by stimuli that produce strong postsynaptic excitation and the latter by stimuli that produce weaker postsynaptic excitation. It has not been determined whether these properties also apply to LTP and LTD in the inhibitory synapses between Purkinje neurons and the neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), a site that has been implicated in certain types of motor learning. DCN cells exhibit a prominent rebound depolarization (RD) and associated spike burst upon release from hyperpolarization. In these cells, LTP can be elicited by short, high-frequency trains of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), which reliably evoke an RD. LTD is induced if the same protocol is applied with conditions where the amount of postsynaptic excitation is reduced. The polarity of the change in synaptic strength is correlated with the amount of RD-evoked spike firing during the induction protocol. Thus, some important computational principles that govern the induction of use-dependent change in excitatory synaptic efficacy also apply to inhibitory synapses.},

	Abstract = {In the gastrointestinal tract, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) generate a pacemaker activity. They produce electric slow waves that trigger and coordinate gut smooth muscle contractions. Interstitial cells of Cajal&apos;s slender shape is revealed by KIT immunostaining. Based on several features, including KIT expression and KIT dependence, ICC-like cells were identified in nongastrointestinal tissues. Here, we investigated in the mouse whether uterine contractions depend on ICC-like cells&apos; activity. By labeling KIT-expressing cells, we found putative ICC-like cells in the uterus, observed as KIT-positive interstitial, long spindle-shaped cells with fine branched cytoplasm processes, distributed in muscular layers and in subepithelial connective tissue. We then checked the potential KIT dependence of ex vivo contractile activity of the uterus by combining genetic and pharmacological approaches, using the Kit W-v hypomorphic mutation, and imatinib as a KIT noncompetitive inhibitor. We found a significant reduction in frequency of longitudinal uterine contractions in Kit W-v/Kit W-v compared with Kit+/+ mice, whereas amplitude was unaffected. There was no difference in frequency or amplitude of circular uterine contractions between Kit W-v/Kit W-v and Kit+/+ mice. Ex vivo treatment of Kit+/+ uterine horns with imatinib resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the frequency and amplitude of longitudinal myometrial contractions. Amplitude and frequency of circular contractions were unaffected in presence of imatinib. These concurrent results suggest that longitudinal contractions of the uterus depend on a KIT signaling pathway of ICC-like cells. The existence of ICC-like cells in the myometrium may enhance our understanding of uterine spontaneous contractile activity and suggest new approaches for treatment of uterine contractility disorders.},

	Abstract = {Collective cell migration in tissues occurs throughout embryonic development, during wound healing, and in cancerous tumor invasion, yet most detailed knowledge of cell migration comes from single-cell studies. As single cells migrate, the shape of the cell body fluctuates dramatically through cyclic processes of extension, adhesion, and retraction, accompanied by erratic changes in migration direction. Within confluent cell layers, such subcellular motions must be coupled between neighbors, yet the influence of these subcellular motions on collective migration is not known. Here we study motion within a confluent epithelial cell sheet, simultaneously measuring collective migration and subcellular motions, covering a broad range of length scales, time scales, and cell densities. At large length scales and time scales collective migration slows as cell density rises, yet the fastest cells move in large, multicell groups whose scale grows with increasing cell density. This behavior has an intriguing analogy to dynamic heterogeneities found in particulate systems as they become more crowded and approach a glass transition. In addition we find a diminishing self-diffusivity of short-wavelength motions within the cell layer, and growing peaks in the vibrational density of states associated with cooperative cell-shape fluctuations. Both of these observations are also intriguingly reminiscent of a glass transition. Thus, these results provide a broad and suggestive analogy between cell motion within a confluent layer and the dynamics of supercooled colloidal and molecular fluids approaching a glass transition.},

	Abstract = {The threat to human health posed by antibiotic resistance is of growing concern. Many commensal and pathogenic organisms have developed resistance to well established and newer antibiotics. The major selection pressure driving changes in the frequency of antibiotic resistance is the volume of drug use. However, establishing a quantitative relationship between the frequency of resistance and volume of drug use has proved difficult. Using population genetic methods and epidemiological observations, we report an analysis of the influence of the selective pressure imposed by the volume of drug use on temporal changes in resistance. Analytical expressions are derived to delineate key relationships between resistance and drug consumption. The analyses indicate that the time scale for emergence of resistance under a constant selective pressure is typically much shorter than the decay time after cessation or decline in the volume of drug use and that significant reductions in resistance require equally significant reductions in drug consumption. These results highlight the need for early intervention once resistance is detected.},

	Abstract = {Calcium can activate mitochondrial metabolism, and the possibility that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and extrusion modulate free cytosolic [Ca2+] (Cac) now has renewed interest. We use whole-cell and perforated patch clamp methods together with rapid local perfusion to introduce probes and inhibitors to rat chromaffin cells, to evoke Ca2+ entry, and to monitor Ca2+-activated currents that report near-surface [Ca2+]. We show that rapid recovery from elevations of Cac requires both the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and the mitochondrial energization that drives Ca2+ uptake through it. Applying imaging and single-cell photometric methods, we find that the probe rhod-2 selectively localizes to mitochondria and uses its responses to quantify mitochondrial free [Ca2+] (Cam). The indicated resting Cam of 100-200 nM is similar to the resting Cac reported by the probes indo-1 and Calcium Green, or its dextran conjugate in the cytoplasm. Simultaneous monitoring of Cam and Cac at high temporal resolution shows that, although Cam increases less than Cac, mitochondrial sequestration of Ca2+ is fast and has high capacity. We find that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake limits the rise and underlies the rapid decay of Cac excursions produced by Ca2+ entry or by mobilization of reticular stores. We also find that subsequent export of Ca2+ from mitochondria, seen as declining Cam, prolongs complete Cac recovery and that suppressing export of Ca2+, by inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/ Ca2+ exchanger, reversibly hastens final recovery of Cac. We conclude that mitochondria are active participants in cellular Ca2+ signaling, whose unique role is determined by their ability to rapidly accumulate and then release large quantities of Ca2+.},

	Abstract = {Patch-clamp recording permits investigation of the gating kinetics of single ion channels. Careful statistical analysis of kinetic data can yield clues as to the molecular events underlying channel gating. However, it is important that such analysis should take full account of the limitations that arise from the finite time resolution of patch-clamp recording techniques. Single-ion-channel data are generally interpreted in terms of Markov process models of channel gating mechanisms. Experimental channel records suffer from time interval omission, i.e. failure to detect brief channel openings and closings. This leads to an identifiability problem when analysing single-channel data, i.e. different gating mechanisms provide equally convincing descriptions of the same experimental data. We consider a two-state Markov model of receptor-channel gating in which the channel opening rate is proportional to the agonist concentration, C in equilibrium with OA. By using computer-simulated data, the approximate likelihood of the data is maximized to yield parameter estimates for the model. At a single agonist concentration there is an identifiability problem in that two pairs of parameter estimates are obtained. The &apos;true&apos; parameter estimates cannot be distinguished from the &apos;false&apos; ones. By considering data corresponding to a range of agonist concentrations one may identify the &apos;true&apos; parameter estimates as those that do not change as the agonist concentration is increased. Alternatively, one may identify the &apos;true&apos; parameter estimates directly by maximizing a global likelihood, the latter being obtained by simultaneous consideration of data obtained at several different agonist concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {If airway smooth muscle shortened in vivo to the extent that it does in vitro, then maximal bronchoconstriction would result in complete closure of virtually all airways. The fact that this does not happen indicates the existence of inhibitory mechanisms preventing maximal muscle shortening. There are many factors potentially limiting shortening in vivo. In this study we investigated one of these factors, the orientation of the smooth muscle around the airway wall. The airway was modeled as a cylinder of given wall thickness around which the muscle was wound as a spiral. The longitudinal and circumferential elasticities of the airway were embodied in a 2 x 2 matrix of elastic coefficients. We investigated smooth muscle shortening under three conditions: 1) a longitudinally stiff airway, 2) a circumferentially stiff airway, and 3) a longitudinally and circumferentially compressible airway. In case 1, for a given degree of smooth muscle shortening, airway resistance increased markedly with increasing pitch of the smooth muscle spiral. On the other hand, the muscle tension required to elicit a given change in resistance also increased markedly with pitch. In case 2, the effect with increasing pitch was reversed. In case 3, resistance first increased and then decreased as spiral pitch increased. Similarly, the muscle tension required to elicit a given change in resistance first increased and then decreased with pitch. These results suggest that the orientation of the smooth muscle about the airway may be very important in determining airway responsiveness.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ uptake into the intracellular stores of permeabilized hepatocytes was entirely dependent on ATP and substantially inhibited by either ionomycin or thapsigargin, although both were required for complete inhibition. Unidirectional efflux of 45Ca2+ after removal of ATP from cells loaded to steady state (1.60+/-0.12 nmol/10(6) cells) was monoexponential and occurred with a half-time of 103+/-10 s. However, the 45Ca2+ content of the stores did not return to their pre-ATP level, but reached a plateau at 0.12+/-0.04 nmol/10(6) cells. A similar amount of Ca2+ was trapped within the stores when Ca2+ uptake was prevented by thapsigargin and chelation of Ca2+; at all temperatures between 2 degreesC and 37 degreesC; and after stores had first been loaded with unlabelled Ca2+. Simultaneous addition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and inhibition of Ca2+ uptake reduced the amount of trapped Ca2+ to a level consistent with InsP3 rapidly and more completely emptying a fraction of the stores that could be only partially emptied by the passive leak. After dilution of the specific activity of the 45Ca2+ under conditions that maintained the steady-state activities of the pumps and leaks, the stores rapidly lost their entire 45Ca2+ content. We conclude that the channel responsible for mediating the leak of Ca2+ abruptly closes when the luminal [Ca2+] of the intracellular stores falls below a critical threshold corresponding to about 7% of their steady-state loading. Whereas InsP3 is capable of completely emptying a fraction of the stores, regulation of the passive leak by luminal [Ca2+] is likely to prevent it from completely emptying them; such regulation may ensure that the many other functions of Ca2+ within the endoplasmic reticulum are not compromised.},

	Abstract = {Adenophostin A is the most potent known agonist of D-myo-inositol 1, 4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] receptors. Equilibrium competition binding studies with 3H-Ins(1,4,5)P3 showed that the interaction of a totally synthetic adenophostin A with both hepatic and cerebellar Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors was indistinguishable from that of the natural product. At pH 8.3, a synthetic analog of adenophostin A (which we named acyclophostin), in which most elements of the ribose ring have been removed, bound with substantially higher affinity (Kd = 2.76 +/- 0.26 nM) than Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Kd = 7.96 +/- 1.02 nM) to the 3H-Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding sites of hepatic membranes. At pH 7, acyclophostin (EC50 = 209 +/- 12 nM) and Ins(1,4,5)P3 (EC50 = 153 +/- 11 nM) stimulated 45Ca++ release to the same maximal extent and from the same intracellular stores of permeabilized hepatocytes. Comparison of the affinities of a range of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and adenophostin analogs with their abilities to stimulate Ca++ release revealed that although all other agonists had similar EC50/Kd ratios, that for acyclophostin was significantly higher. Similar results were obtained with cerebellar membranes, which express almost entirely type 1 InsP3 receptors. When the radioligand binding and functional assays of hepatocytes were performed under identical conditions, the higher EC50/Kd ratio for acyclophostin was retained at pH 8.3, but it was similar to that for Ins(1,4,5)P3 when the assays were performed at pH 7. To directly assess whether acyclophostin was a partial agonist of hepatic Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors, the kinetics of 45Ca++ efflux from permeabilized hepatocytes was measured with a temporal resolution of 80 ms using rapid superfusion. At pH 7, the kinetics of 45Ca++ release, including the maximal rate of release, evoked by maximal concentrations of acyclophostin or Ins(1,4,5)P3 were indistinguishable. At pH 8.3, however, the maximal rate of 45Ca++ release evoked by a supramaximal concentration of acyclophostin was only 69 +/- 7% of that evoked by Ins(1,4,5)P3. We conclude that acyclophostin is the highest affinity ribose-modified analog of adenophostin so far synthesized, that at high pH it is a partial agonist of inositol trisphosphate receptors, and that it may provide a structure from which to develop high-affinity antagonists of inositol trisphosphate receptors.},

	Abstract = {Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded with loose patch electrodes placed over visualized boutons on the surface of rat pelvic ganglion cells. At 34 degrees C the time to peak of the EPSC was about 0.7 ms, and a single exponential described the declining phase with a time constant of about 4.0 ms; these times were not correlated with changes in the amplitude of the EPSC. The amplitude-frequency histogram of the EPSC at individual boutons was well described by a single Gaussian-distribution that possessed a variance similar to that of the electrical noise. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis of the EPSCs at a bouton indicated that about 120 ACh receptor channels were available beneath boutons for interaction with a quantum of ACh. The characteristics of these EPSCs were compared with the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the quantal release of 9000 acetylcholine (ACh) molecules onto receptor patches of density 1400 microns-2 and 0.41 micron diameter, using a kinetic scheme of interaction between ACh and the receptors similar to that observed at the neuromuscular junction. The simulated EPSC generated in this way had temporal characteristics similar to those of the experimental EPSC when either the diffusion of the ACh is slowed or allowance is made for a finite period of transmitter release from the bouton. The amplitude of the simulated EPSC then exhibited stochastic fluctuations similar to those of the experimental EPSC.},

	Abstract = {Microdomains of Ca(2+), which are formed at sites where Ca(2+) enters the cytoplasm either at the cell surface or at the internal stores, are a key element of Ca(2+) signalling. The term microdomain includes the elementary events that are the basic building blocks of Ca(2+) signals. As Ca(2+) enters the cytoplasm, it produces a local plume of Ca(2+) that has been given different names (sparks, puffs, sparklets and syntillas). These elementary events can combine to produce larger microdomains. The significance of these localized domains of Ca(2+) is that they can regulate specific cellular processes in different regions of the cell. Such microdomains are particularly evident in neurons where both pre- and postsynaptic events are controlled by highly localized pulses of Ca(2+). The ability of single neurons to process enormous amounts of information depends upon such miniaturization of the Ca(2+) signalling system. Control of cardiac cell contraction and gene transcription provides another example of how the parallel processing of Ca(2+) signalling can occur through microdomains of intracellular Ca(2+).},

	Abstract = {InsP3 has two important functions in generating Ca2+ oscillations. It releases Ca2+ from the internal store and it can contribute to Ca2+ entry. A hypothesis has been developed to describe a mechanism for Ca2+ oscillations with particular emphasis on the way agonist concentration regulates oscillator frequency. The main idea is that the InsP3 receptors are sensitized to release Ca2+ periodically by cyclical fluctuations of Ca2+ within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Each time a pulse of Ca2+ is released, the luminal level of Ca2+ declines and has to be replenished before the InsP3 receptors are resensitized to deliver the next pulse of Ca2+. It is this loading of the internal store that explains why frequency is sensitive to external Ca2+ and may also account for how variations in agonist concentration are translated into changes in oscillation frequency. Variations in agonist-induced entry of external Ca2+, which can occur through different mechanisms, determine the variable rates of store loading responsible for adjusting the sensitivity of the InsP3 receptors to produce the periodic pulses of Ca2+. The Ca2+ oscillator is an effective analogue-to-digital converter in that variations in the concentration of the external stimulus are translated into a change in oscillator frequency.},

	Abstract = {New insights into how Ca(2+) regulates learning and memory have begun to provide clues as to how the amyloid-dependent remodelling of neuronal Ca(2+) signalling pathways can disrupt the mechanisms of learning and memory in Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). The calcium hypothesis of AD proposes that activation of the amyloidogenic pathway remodels the neuronal Ca(2+) signalling pathways responsible for cognition by enhancing the entry of Ca(2+) and/or the release of internal Ca(2+) by ryanodine receptors or InsP(3) receptors. The specific proposal is that Ca(2+) signalling remodelling results in a persistent elevation in the level of Ca(2+) that constantly erases newly acquired memories by enhancing the mechanism of long-term depression (LTD). Neurons can still form memories through the process of LTP, but this stored information is rapidly removed by the persistent activation of LTD. Further dysregulation in Ca(2+) signalling will then go on to induce the neurodegeneration that characterizes the later stages of dementia.},

	Abstract = {ATP enhances Ca(2+) release from inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)R). However, the three isoforms of InsP(3)R are reported to respond to ATP with differing sensitivities. Ca(2+) release through InsP(3)R1 is positively regulated at lower ATP concentrations than InsP(3)R3, and InsP(3)R2 has been reported to be insensitive to ATP modulation. We have reexamined these differences by studying the effects of ATP on InsP(3)R2 and InsP(3)R3 expressed in isolation on a null background in DT40 InsP(3)R knockout cells. We report that the Ca(2+)-releasing activity as well as the single channel open probability of InsP(3)R2 was enhanced by ATP, but only at submaximal InsP(3) levels. Further, InsP(3)R2 was more sensitive to ATP modulation than InsP(3)R3 under similar experimental conditions. Mutations in the ATPB sites of InsP(3)R2 and InsP(3)R3 were generated, and the functional consequences of these mutations were tested. Surprisingly, mutation of the ATPB site in InsP(3)R3 had no effect on ATP modulation, suggesting an additional locus for the effects of ATP on this isoform. In contrast, ablation of the ATPB site of InsP(3)R2 eliminated the enhancing effects of ATP. Furthermore, this mutation had profound effects on the patterns of intracellular calcium signals, providing evidence for the physiological significance of ATP binding to InsP(3)R2.},

Isotonic and isometric contractile properties of isolated TSM from Fisher and Lewis rats (each n=10) were investigated, and myosin crossbridge (CB) number, force and kinetics in both strains were calculated using Huxley&apos;s equations adapted to nonsarcomeric muscles. Maximum unloaded shortening velocity and maximum extent of muscle shortening were higher in Fisher than in Lewis rats (approximately 46% and approximately 42%, respectively), whereas peak isometric tension was similar. The curvature of the hyperbolic force/velocity relationship did not differ between strains. Myosin CB number and unitary force were similar in both strains. The duration of CB detachment and attachment was shorter in Fisher than in Lewis rats (approximately -46% and -34%, respectively). In Fisher rats, these results show that inherited, genetically determined factors of airway hyperresponsiveness are associated with changes in crossbridge kinetics, contributing to an increased tracheal smooth muscle shortening capacity and velocity.},

	Abstract = {The suppression of self-generated electrosensory noise (reafference) and other predictable signals in the elasmobranch medulla is accomplished in part by an adaptive filter mechanism, which now appears to represent a more universal form of the modifiable efference copy mechanism discovered by Bell. It also exists in the gymnotid electrosensory lateral lobe and mechanosensory lateral line nucleus in other teleosts. In the skate dorsal nucleus, motor corollary discharge, proprioceptive and descending electrosensory signals all contribute in an independent and additive fashion to a cancellation input to the projection neurons that suppresses their response to reafference. The form of the cancellation signal is quite stable and apparently well-preserved between bouts of a particular behavior, but it can also be modified within minutes to match changes in the form of the reafference associated with that behavior. Motor corollary discharge, proprioceptive and electrosensory inputs are each relayed to the dorsal nucleus from granule cells of the vestibulolateral cerebellum. Direct evidence from intracellular studies and direct electrical stimulation of the parallel fiber projection support an adaptive filter model that places a principal site of the filter&apos;s plasticity at the synapses between parallel fibers and projection neurons.},

	Abstract = {Astrocytes and endothelial cells are in close contact with each other at the blood-brain barrier, where important molecular transports take place. Despite these key morphological and functional properties, little is known regarding the dynamic signalling processes that occur between these two cell types. We investigated astrocyte-endothelial cell calcium signalling mechanisms in a coculture model prepared from primary rat cortical astrocytes and ECV304 cells. We used flash photolysis of caged inositol-trisphosphate (IP3) and gentle mechanical stimulation to trigger astrocyte-endothelial cell calcium signals and to investigate the underlying propagation mechanisms. Photolytically releasing IP3 in a single cell triggered increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration that propagated between astrocytes and endothelial cells in either direction. These propagating calcium signals did not cross cell-free zones and were not affected by fast superfusion or by the purinergic inhibitors apyrase and suramin, indicating that they are communicated through an intracellular pathway in conjunction with gap junctions. Electrophysiological experiments confirmed a low degree of astrocyte-endothelial cell electrical cell-to-cell coupling. Mechanical stimulation of a single cell also triggered astrocyte-endothelial cell calcium signals but, in contrast to the former triggering mode, these signals crossed cell-free zones and were significantly inhibited by apyrase, thus indicating the involvement of an extracellular and purinergic messenger. Astrocyte-endothelial cell calcium signalling also occurred in cocultures prepared with astrocytes and primary rat brain capillary endothelial cells. We conclude that astrocytes and endothelial cells can exchange fast-acting calcium signals (time scale of seconds) that can be communicated through an intracellular/gap junctional pathway and an extracellular purinergic pathway.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+-ATPases (pumps) are key actors in the regulation of Ca2+ in eukaryotic cells and are thus essential to the correct functioning of the cell machinery. They have high affinity for Ca2+ and can efficiently regulate it down to very low concentration levels. Two of the pumps have been known for decades (the SERCA and PMCA pumps); one (the SPCA pump) has only become known recently. Each pump is the product of a multigene family, the number of isoforms being further increased by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts. The three pumps share the basic features of the catalytic mechanism but differ in a number of properties related to tissue distribution, regulation, and role in the cellular homeostasis of Ca2+. The molecular understanding of the function of the pumps has received great impetus from the solution of the three-dimensional structure of one of them, the SERCA pump. These spectacular advances in the structure and molecular mechanism of the pumps have been accompanied by the emergence and rapid expansion of the topic of pump malfunction, which has paralleled the rapid expansion of knowledge in the topic of Ca2+-signaling dysfunction. Most of the pump defects described so far are genetic: when they are very severe, they produce gross and global disturbances of Ca2+ homeostasis that are incompatible with cell life. However, pump defects may also be of a type that produce subtler, often tissue-specific disturbances that affect individual components of the Ca2+-controlling and/or processing machinery. They do not bring cells to immediate death but seriously compromise their normal functioning.},

	Abstract = {Pituitary hormones are released in pulses as a result of episodic patterns of electrical activity in neuroendocrine neurons. The mechanisms underlying such pulsatility have, however, been difficult to elucidate. For example, the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone neurons regulating reproductive functioning have a sparse and scattered distribution within the hypothalamus which has made definitive electrophysiological investigation impracticable. Little is known not only of their electrical characteristics, but also of the critical neural components with which they interact to form the so-called &quot;luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone pulse generator&quot;. We have used here a neural modelling approach, based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of a single neuron, to provide a simple dynamical network model of this neuroendocrine pulse generator. We have found that the minimal components required to generate pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion arise from combining luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone neurons with reciprocally connected inhibitory interneurons and an external stimulatory input. Local GABA neurons and ascending noradrenergic and/or adrenergic inputs have been used as the biological basis for these respective components. The network displays a wide repertoire of behaviours comparable with experimental observations, including some thought previously to be paradoxical. The capacity of this model network to display complex behavioural features interpretable against experimental evidence suggests that this type of modelling may become a necessary adjunct to empirical studies of pulsatile neuroendocrine systems.},

	Abstract = {Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a characteristic feature of asthma. It has been proposed that an increase in the shortening velocity of airway smooth muscle (ASM) could contribute to AHR. To address this possibility, we tested whether an increase in the isotonic shortening velocity of ASM is associated with an increase in the rate and total amount of shortening when ASM is subjected to an oscillating load, as occurs during breathing. Experiments were performed in vitro using 27 rat tracheal ASM strips supramaximally stimulated with methacholine. Isotonic velocity at 20% isometric force (Fiso) was measured, and then the load on the muscle was varied sinusoidally (0.33 $\pm$ 0.25 Fiso, 1.2 Hz) for 20 min, while muscle length was measured. A large amplitude oscillation was applied every 4 min to simulate a deep breath. We found that: 1) ASM strips with a higher isotonic velocity shortened more quickly during the force oscillations, both initially (P &lt; 0.001) and after the simulated deep breaths (P = 0.002); 2) ASM strips with a higher isotonic velocity exhibited a greater total shortening during the force oscillation protocol (P &lt; 0.005); and 3) the effect of an increase in isotonic velocity was at least comparable in magnitude to the effect of a proportional increase in ASM force-generating capacity. A cross-bridge model showed that an increase in the total amount of shortening with increased isotonic velocity could be explained by a change in either the cycling rate of phosphorylated cross bridges or the rate of myosin light chain phosphorylation. We conclude that, if asthma involves an increase in ASM velocity, this could be an important factor in the associated AHR.},

	Abstract = {Existing models of uterine contractions assumed a top-down approach in which the function at the organ or tissue level was explained by the behavior of smaller basic units. A new model of the excitation-contraction process in a single myometrial myocyte was recently developed. This model may be used in a bottom-up approach for the description of the contribution of cellular phenomena to the overall performance of the tissue or organ. In this review, we briefly survey current knowledge of uterine electrophysiology and contractility as well as current modeling techniques, which were successfully used to study the function of various types of muscle cells. In the physiological part of the review, we relate to mechanisms of intracellular Ca(2+) control, Ca(2+) oscillations, and Ca(2+) waves and to the various membranal transport mechanisms regulating ion exchange between the intracellular and extracellular spaces. In addition, we describe the process leading from excitation to contraction. In the modeling part of the review, we present the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of excitation in the squid axon as well as models of Ca(2+) control and the latch-bridge model of Hai and Murphy describing the kinetics of smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction. We also present integrative models describing more than one of these phenomena. Finally, we suggest how these modeling techniques can be applied to modeling myometrial contraction and thus may significantly contribute to current efforts of research of uterine function.},

	Abstract = {1. We have studied capacitative calcium entry (CCE) under different experimental conditions in fura-2-loaded mouse pancreatic acinar cells by digital microscopic fluorimetry. CCE was investigated during [Ca2+]i decay after cell stimulation with a supramaximal concentration of ACh (10 microM) or during Ca2+ readmission in Ca2+-depleted cells (pretreated with thapsigargin or ACh). 2. La3+ and Zn2+ (100 microM) inhibited CCE during Ca2+ readmission but had negligible effects during ACh decay. In contrast flufenamic acid (100 microM), an inhibitor of non-selective cation channels, genistein (10 microM), a broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and piceatannol (10 microM), an inhibitor specific for non-receptor Syk tyrosine kinase, inhibited CCE during ACh decay but not during Ca2+ reintroduction. 3. Simultaneous detection of Mn2+ entry and [Ca2+]i measurement showed that, in the presence of extracellular calcium, application of 100 microM Mn2+ during ACh decay resulted in manganese influx without alteration of calcium influx, whilst when applied during Ca2+ readmission, Mn2+ entry was significantly smaller and induced a clear inhibition of CCE. 4. Application of the specific protein kinase C inhibitor GF109293X (3 microM) reduced CCE in Ca2+-depleted cells, whereas the activator phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (3 microM) increased Ca2+ entry. 5. Based on these results we propose that cholinergic stimulation of mouse pancreatic acinar cells induces Ca2+ influx with an initial phase operated by a non-specific cation channel, sensitive to flufenamic acid and tyrosine kinase inhibitors but insensitive to lanthanum and divalent cations, followed by a moderately Ca2+-selective conductance inhibited by lanthanum and divalent cations.},

Mitochondrial depolarization in response to carbonylcyanide-p-tryfluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone or rotenone (assessed by confocal microscopy using rhodamine-123) induced a partial but statistically significant reduction in the decay of Ca(2+) signals under different experimental conditions. Spreading of Ca(2+) waves evoked by the pancreatic secretagogue cholecystokinin cholecystokinin octapeptide was accelerated by mitochondrial inhibitors, whereas the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillations in response to physiological levels of this hormone were suppressed by rotenone and carbonylcyanide-p-tryfluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone. Oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase, did no affect either propagation of calcium waves nor [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. Individual mitochondria of rhod-2 loaded acinar cells showed heterogeneous matrix Ca(2+) concentration increases in response to oscillatory and maximal levels of cholecystokinin octapeptide. On the other hand, using Ba(2+) for unequivocal study of capacitative calcium entry we found that mitochondrial inhibitors did not affect this process. Our results show that although the role of mitochondria as a Ca(2+) clearing system in exocrine cells is quantitatively secondary, they play an essential role in the spatial propagation of Ca(2+) waves and in the development of [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations.},

	Abstract = {1. The passive tension and sarcomere length of relaxed frog skeletal muscle fibres were measured in response to imposed length stretches. The tension response to a constant-velocity stretch exhibited a clear discontinuity. Tension rose more rapidly during the initial approximately 0.4 % L0 of the stretch than during the latter stages (where L0 is the resting length of the fibre). This initial tension response is attributed to the short-range elastic component (SREC). 2. The use of paired triangular stretches revealed that the maximum tension produced during the SREC response of the second stretch was significantly reduced by the first stretch. This history-dependent behaviour of the SREC reflects thixotropic stiffness changes that have been previously described in relaxed muscle. 3. The biphasic nature of the SREC tension response to movement was most apparent during the first imposed length change after a period at a fixed length, irrespective of the direction of movement. 4. If a relaxed muscle was subjected to an imposed triangular length change so that the muscle was initially stretched and subsequently shortened back to its original fibre length, the resting tension at the end of the stretch was reduced relative to its initial pre-stretch value. Following the end of the stretch, tension slowly increased towards its initial value but the tension recovery was not accompanied by a contemporaneous increase in sarcomere length. This finding suggests that the resting tension of a relaxed muscle fibre is not entirely due to passive elasticity. The results are compatible with the suggestion that a portion of the resting tension - the filamentary resting tension (FRT) - is produced by a low level of active force generation. 5. If a second identical stretch was imposed on the muscle at a time when the resting tension was reduced by the previous stretch, the maximal tension produced during the second stretch was the same as that produced during the first, despite the second stretch commencing from a lower initial resting tension. 6. In experiments using paired triangular length changes, an inter-stretch interval of zero did not produce a substantially greater thixotropic reduction in the second stretch elastic limit force than an inter-stretch interval in the range 0.5-1 s. 7. A theoretical model was developed in which the SREC and FRT arise as manifestations of a small number of slowly cycling cross-bridges linking the actin and myosin filaments of a relaxed skeletal muscle. The predictions of the model are compatible with many of the experimental observations. If the SREC and FRT are indeed due to cross-bridge activity, the model suggests that the cross-bridge attachment rate must increase during interfilamentary movement. A mechanism (based on misregistration between the actin binding sites and the myosin cross-bridges) by which this might arise is presented.},

	Abstract = {Hormones and neurotransmitters mobilize Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum via inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors, but how a single target cell encodes different extracellular signals to generate specific cytosolic Ca(2+) responses is unknown. In pancreatic acinar cells, acetylcholine evokes local Ca(2+) spiking in the apical granular pole, whereas cholecystokinin elicits a mixture of local and global cytosolic Ca(2+) signals. We show that IP(3), cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) evoke cytosolic Ca(2+) spiking by activating common oscillator units composed of IP(3) and ryanodine receptors. Acetylcholine activation of these common oscillator units is triggered via IP(3) receptors, whereas cholecystokinin responses are triggered via a different but converging pathway with NAADP and cyclic ADP-ribose receptors. Cholecystokinin potentiates the response to acetylcholine, making it global rather than local, an effect mediated specifically by cyclic ADP-ribose receptors. In the apical pole there is a common early activation site for Ca(2+) release, indicating that the three types of Ca(2+) release channels are clustered together and that the appropriate receptors are selected at the earliest step of signal generation.},

We have investigated the process that transforms local Ca2+ spikes to global Ca2+ transients, focusing on the interactions of multiple intracellular messengers. ACh-elicited local Ca2+ spikes were transformed into a global sustained Ca2+ response by cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) or nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), whereas inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) had a much weaker effect. In contrast, the response elicited by a low CCK concentration was strongly potentiated by IP3, whereas cADPR and NAADP had little effect. Experiments with messenger mixtures revealed a local interaction between IP3 and NAADP and a stronger global potentiating interaction between cADPR and NAADP. NAADP strongly amplified the local Ca2+ release evoked by a cADPR/IP3 mixture eliciting a vigorous global Ca2+ response. Different combinations of Ca2+ releasing messengers can shape the spatio-temporal patterns of cytosolic Ca2+ signals. NAADP and cADPR are emerging as key messengers in the globalization of Ca2+ signals.},

	Abstract = {Biphasic regulation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization by cytosolic Ca2+ is believed to contribute to regenerative intracellular Ca2+ signals. Since cells typically express several IP3 receptor isoforms and the effects of cytosolic Ca2+ are not mediated by a single mechanism, it is important to resolve the properties of each receptor subtype. Full-length rat types-1 and -3 IP3 receptors were expressed in insect Sf9 cells at levels 10-40-fold higher than the endogenous receptors. The expressed receptors were glycosylated and assembled into tetramers, and binding of [3H]IP3 to each subtype was regulated by cytosolic Ca2+. The effects of increased [Ca2+] on native cerebellar and type-1 receptors expressed in Sf9 cells were indistinguishable. A maximally effective increase in [Ca2+] reversibly inhibited [3H]IP3 binding by approx. 50% by decreasing the number of IP3-binding sites (Bmax) without affecting their affinity for IP3. The effects of Ca2+ on type-3 receptors were more complex: increasing [Ca2+] first stimulated [3H]IP3 binding by increasing Bmax, and then inhibited it by causing a substantial decrease in the affinity of the receptor for IP3. The different effects of Ca2+ on the receptor subtypes were not a consequence of limitations in the availability of accessory proteins or of artifactual effects of Ca2+ on membrane structure. We conclude that Ca2+ can inhibit IP3 binding to types-1 and -3 IP3 receptors although by different mechanisms, and that IP3 binding to type-3 receptors is stimulated at intermediate [Ca2+]. A consequence of these differences is that, at resting cytosolic [Ca2+], type-3 receptors are more sensitive than type-1 receptors to IP3, but the situation reverses at higher cytosolic [Ca2+]. Such differences may be important in generating the spatially and temporally complex changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] evoked by receptors linked to IP3 formation.},

	Abstract = {Calmodulin inhibits both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) binding to, and IP3-evoked Ca2+ release by, cerebellar IP3 receptors [Patel, Morris, Adkins, O&apos;Beirne and Taylor (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 94, 11627-11632]. In the present study, full-length rat type-1 and -3 IP3 receptors were expressed at high levels in insect Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells and the effects of calmodulin were examined. In the absence of Ca2+, calmodulin caused a concentration-dependent and reversible inhibition of [3H]IP3 binding to type-1 IP3 receptors by decreasing their apparent affinity for IP3. The effect was not reproduced by high concentrations of troponin C, parvalbumin or S-100. Increasing the medium free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]m) inhibited [3H]IP3 binding to type-1 receptors, but the further inhibition caused by a submaximal concentration of calmodulin was similar at each [Ca2+]m. In the absence of Ca2+, 125I-calmodulin bound to a single site on each type-1 receptor subunit and to an additional site in the presence of Ca2+. There was no detectable binding of 125I-calmodulin to type-3 receptors and binding of [3H]IP3 was insensitive to calmodulin at all [Ca2+]m. Both peptide and conventional Ca2+-calmodulin antagonists affected neither [3H]IP3 binding directly nor the inhibitory effect of calmodulin in the absence of Ca2+, but each caused a [Ca2+]m-dependent reversal of the inhibition of [3H]IP3 binding caused by calmodulin. Camstatin, a peptide that binds to calmodulin equally well in the presence or absence of Ca2+, reversed the inhibitory effects of calmodulin on [3H]IP3 binding at all [Ca2+]m. We conclude that calmodulin specifically inhibits [3H]IP3 binding to type-1 IP3 receptors: the first example of a protein regulated by calmodulin in an entirely Ca2+-independent manner. Inhibition of type-1 IP3 receptors by calmodulin may dynamically regulate their sensitivity to IP3 in response to the changes in cytosolic free calmodulin concentration thought to accompany stimulation of neurones.},

	Abstract = {Agonist-induced Ca^2^+ oscillations in rat hepatocytes involve the production of myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP&quot;3), which stimulates the release of Ca^2^+ from intracellular stores. The oscillatory frequency is conditioned by the agonist concentration. This study investigated the role of IP&quot;3 concentration in the modulation of oscillatory frequency by using microinjected photolabile IP&quot;3 analogs. Photorelease of IP&quot;3 during hormone-induced oscillations evoked a Ca^2^+ spike, after which oscillations resumed with a delay corresponding to the period set by the agonists. IP&quot;3 photorelease had no influence on the frequency of oscillations. After photorelease of 1-(@a-glycerophosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol-4,5-diphosphate (GPIP&quot;2), a slowly metabolized IP&quot;3 analog, the frequency of oscillations initially increased by 34% and declined to its original level within ~6min. Both IP&quot;3 and GPIP&quot;2 effects can be explained by their rate of degradation: the half-life of IP&quot;3, which is a few seconds, can account for the lack of influence of IP&quot;3 photorelease on the frequency, whereas the slower metabolism of GPIP&quot;2 allowed a transient acceleration of the oscillations. The phase shift introduced by IP&quot;3 is likely the result of the brief elevation of Ca^2^+ during spiking that resets the IP&quot;3 receptor to a state of maximum inactivation. A mathematical model of Ca^2^+ oscillations is in satisfactory agreement with the observed results.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we show that Wenckebach-like patterns of intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca^2^+]&quot;i, arise in non-excitable cell models when driven repetitively by the application of agonists that activate the phospholinositide-signalling pathway. These patterns are similar to action potential responses observed in excitable cells when driven periodically by external current stimuli. A model exclusively studied in this paper is based on the receptor-operated model of Cuthbertson &amp; Chay (1991,Cell Calcium12,97-108), which is formulated under the assumptions that phospholipase C is a GTPase activating protein and a build-up of the GTP-bound @a-subunit is a slow dynamic variable responsible for the refractory period. Similarities between [Ca^2^+]&quot;iresponse and action potential response make it possible to reduce the full dynamic system to a one-dimensional discrete equation designed for cardiac rhythms. The Devil&apos;s staircase constructed from both the dynamic traces and one-dimensional maps shows that the rules governing this staircase are indeed universal even in the agonist phase-locking system. This work thus provides a theoretical explanation for the appearance of blocked and delayed responses of [Ca^2^+]&quot;ispikes observed in the hepatocytes in response to pulsed phenylephrine agonist and, moreover, demonstrates the existence of universality in the agonist pulsed phase-locking system.},

	Abstract = {The synthetic channel [acetyl-(LeuSerSerLeuLeuSerLeu)3-CONH2]6 (pore diameter approximately 8 A, length approximately 30 A) is a bundle of six alpha-helices with blocked termini. This simple channel has complex properties, which are difficult to explain, even qualitatively, by traditional theories: its single-channel currents rectify in symmetrical solutions and its selectivity (defined by reversal potential) is a sensitive function of bathing solution. These complex properties can be fit quantitatively if the channel has fixed charge at its ends, forming a kind of macrodipole, bracketing a central charged region, and the shielding of the fixed charges is described by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations. PNP fits current voltage relations measured in 15 solutions with an r.m.s. error of 3.6% using four adjustable parameters: the diffusion coefficients in the channel&apos;s pore DK = 2.1 x 10(-6) and DCl = 2.6 x 10(-7) cm2/s; and the fixed charge at the ends of the channel of +/- 0.12e (with unequal densities 0.71 M = 0.021e/A on the N-side and -1.9 M = -0.058e/A on the C-side). The fixed charge in the central region is 0.31e (with density P2 = 0.47 M = 0.014e/A). In contrast to traditional theories, PNP computes the electric field in the open channel from all of the charges in the system, by a rapid and accurate numerical procedure. In essence, PNP is a theory of the shielding of fixed (i.e., permanent) charge of the channel by mobile charge and by the ionic atmosphere in and near the channel&apos;s pore. The theory fits a wide range of data because the ionic contents and potential profile in the channel change significantly with experimental conditions, as they must, if the channel simultaneously satisfies the Poisson and Nernst-Planck equations and boundary conditions. Qualitatively speaking, the theory shows that small changes in the ionic atmosphere of the channel (i.e., shielding) make big changes in the potential profile and even bigger changes in flux, because potential is a sensitive function of charge and shielding, and flux is an exponential function of potential.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes, from a mathematical viewpoint, the cellular changes in the granulosa of ovarian follicles during their terminal development. A dynamic model takes into account the processes of (1) cell division, (2) exit from the cell cycle towards differentiation, and (3) apoptotic cell death. Proliferative cells leave the cycle in an irreversible way. The risk of entering apoptosis applies to non-cycling cells. Changes in the cell numbers and in the growth fraction are derived from differential equations. The transitions between the different cell states are ruled by time-dependent rates. Numerical applications of the model concern ovulating and degenerating ovarian follicles in the ewe. The main feature of the ovulating case is the progressive exhaustion of the proliferating compartment for the benefit of the non-cycling cells. From an initial mainly proliferative state the granulosa progressively switches to a highly differentiated state, so that the growth fraction continuously decreases. In the atretic cases, the pattern of changes in the total viable cell number is influenced by the follicular age at the onset of the apoptotic process and by the intensity of the cell death rate. As apoptosis affects the non-cycling cells, the growth fraction is no longer strictly decreasing. The sensitivity of the model to the parameters is studied in a more general framework than the granulosa cell population.},

We approached the study of the control of follicular development at the level of follicular granulosa cells, on the experimental as well as mathematical modelling grounds. We built a mathematical model allowing for the processes of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. State variables correspond to the numbers of cells undergoing these different processes, while control variables correspond to the cellular transition rates. The model results raised the notion of proliferative resources, which leads to consider the optimal management of these resources and has motivated the settling of an experiment investigating the changes in the growth fraction within the granulosa throughout terminal development. We are now investigating the way gonadotrophins, and especially FSH, operate on granulosa cells, in order to account for the hormonal control of the divergent commitment of granulosa cells towards either proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis. We are thus focusing on the dynamics of cAMP production, which appears to be a keypoint in FSH signal transduction.},

Following rapid steps into high concentrations of glutamate, the activation time course was concentration-independent and limited by transitions between the shut, but fully liganded state and the open state. At lower concentrations, ligand binding was rate-limiting. The resulting sigmoidal activation time course was best fitted by a kinetic model with two glutamate binding sites. Glycine concentration jumps in the continuous presence of glutamate were also best fitted with a two-site model. Agonist and co-agonist binding were better described by an independent, rather than a sequential model. We suggest that the NMDA receptor is at least a tetramer containing four ligand binding subunits, assuming a single binding site per subunit.},

Berkeley Conf. in honor of Neyman &amp; Kiefer, vol. 1, pp. 269-289 (1985] is given, and their results are extended to the case where openings occur in bursts. Expressions are given for the correlation between the first and nth opening in a burst, between the lengths of bursts, and between the number of openings per burst. Each of these sorts of correlation can give information about the connections that exist between the various states of the system; interpretations of the correlations are discussed. Expressions are derived for the distributions of the nth open time, shut time, burst length, etc. following the application of a perturbation (e.g. a voltage jump or a concentration jump). It is shown that these distributions will all be the same (namely the equilibrium distribution) only in the case where the openings, burst lengths, etc. are not correlated. Certain reaction schemes predict a component in the distribution of the number of openings per burst that has a unit mean (i.e. a component of isolated single openings). For some schemes this component is predicted to have zero amplitude, in principle, whereas in others it may be quite prominent. The presence or absence of this component can give information about the way in which the various states of the system are connected. The interpretation in terms of mechanism is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The glial cell is the most numerous cell type in the central nervous system and is believed to play an important role in guiding brain development and in supporting adult brain function. One type of glial cell, the astrocyte also may be an integral computational element in the brain since it undergoes neurotransmitter-triggered signalling. Here we review the role of the astrocyte in the central nervous system, emphasizing receptor-mediated Ca2+ physiology. One focus is the recent discovery that the neurotransmitter glutamate induces a variety of intracellular Ca2+ changes in astrocytes. Simple Ca2+ spikes or intracellular Ca2+ oscillations often appear spatially uniform. However, in many instances, the Ca2+ rise has a significant spatial dimension, beginning in one part of the cell it spreads through the rest of the cell in the form of a wave. With high enough agonist concentration an astrocyte syncitium supports intercellular waves which propagate from cell to cell over relatively long distances. We present results of experiments using more specific pharmacological glutamate receptor agonists. In addition to describing the intercellular Ca2+ wave we present evidence for another form of intercellular signalling. Some possible functions of a long-range glial signalling system are also discussed.},

In addition, the same model provides an acceptable numerical fit of voltage clamp (VC) measurement results. The parameters of the model have been estimated using averaged VC traces, and characteristic values of measured current clamp traces originating from GnRH neurons in hypothalamic slices. The resulting parameter values show a good agreement with literature data in most of the cases. Applying parametric changes, which lead to the increase of baseline potential and enhance cell excitability, the model becomes capable of bursting.

	Abstract = {The elevation of the cytosolic and nuclear Ca(2+) concentration is a fundamental signal transduction mechanism in almost all eukaryotic cells. Interestingly, three Ca(2+)-mobilising second messengers, D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)), cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP(+)) were identified in a phylogenetically wide range of different organisms. Moreover, in an as yet very limited number of cell types, sea urchin eggs, mouse pancreatic acinar cells, and human Jurkat T-lymphocytes, all three Ca(2+)-mobilising ligands have been shown to be involved in the generation of Ca(2+) signals. This situation raises the question why during evolution all three messengers have been conserved in the same cell type. From a theoretical point of view the following points may be considered: (i) redundant mechanisms ensuring intact Ca(2+) signalling even if one system does not work, (ii) the need for subcellularly localised Ca(2+) elevations to obtain a certain physiological response of the cell, and (iii) tight control of a physiological response of the cell by a temporal sequence of Ca(2+) signalling events. These theoretical considerations are compared to the current knowledge regarding the three messengers in sea urchin eggs, mouse pancreatic acinar cells, and human Jurkat T lymphocytes.},

	Abstract = {Several attempts at building a satisfactory model of the glucose-insulin system are recorded in the literature. The minimal model, which is the model currently mostly used in physiological research on the metabolism of glucose, was proposed in the early eighties for the interpretation of the glucose and insulin plasma concentrations following the intravenous glucose tolerance test. It is composed of two parts: the first consists of two differential equations and describes the glucose plasma concentration time-course treating insulin plasma concentration as a known forcing function; the second consists of a single equation and describes the time course of plasma insulin concentration treating glucose plasma concentration as a known forcing function. The two parts are to be separately estimated on the available data. In order to study glucose-insulin homeostasis as a single dynamical system, a unified model would be desirable. To this end, the simple coupling of the original two parts of the minimal model is not appropriate, since it can be shown that, for commonly observed combinations of parameter values, the coupled model would not admit an equilibrium and the concentration of active insulin in the &quot;distant&quot; compartment would be predicted to increase without bounds. For comparison, a simple delay-differential model is introduced, is demonstrated to be globally asymptotically stable around a unique equilibrium point corresponding to the pre-bolus conditions, and is shown to have positive and bounded solutions for all times. The results of fitting the delay-differential model to experimental data from ten healthy volunteers are also shown. It is concluded that a global unified model is both theoretically desirable and practically usable, and that any such model ought to undergo formal analysis to establish its appropriateness and to exclude conflicts with accepted physiological notions.},

	Abstract = {Research conducted over the past two decades has provided convincing evidence that cell death, and more specifically apoptosis, can exceed single cell boundaries and can be strongly influenced by intercellular communication networks. We recently reported that gap junctions (i.e. channels directly connecting the cytoplasm of neighboring cells) composed of connexin43 or connexin26 provide a direct pathway to promote and expand cell death, and that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) diffusion via these channels is crucial to provoke apoptosis in adjacent healthy cells. However, IP(3) itself is not sufficient to induce cell death and additional factors appear to be necessary to create conditions in which IP(3) will exert proapoptotic effects. Although IP(3)-evoked Ca(2+) signaling is known to be required for normal cell survival, it is also actively involved in apoptosis induction and progression. As such, it is evident that an accurate fine-tuning of this signaling mechanism is crucial for normal cell physiology, while a malfunction can lead to cell death. Here, we review the role of IP(3) as an intracellular and intercellular cell death messenger, focusing on the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial synapse, followed by a discussion of plausible elements that can convert IP(3) from a physiological molecule to a killer substance. Finally, we highlight several pathological conditions in which anomalous intercellular IP(3)/Ca(2+) signaling might play a role.                Copyright {\copyright} 2012.

	Abstract = {Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release in intact ventricular myocytes is the major source of Ca which activates cardiac contraction (although Ca influx makes a non-negligible contribution in most species). The fundamental events of SR Ca release are known as Ca sparks. The twitch Ca transient is composed of approximately 10,000 Ca sparks occurring in a given cell, and they are synchronized by the action potential and Ca current. Many factors influence SR Ca release amplitude and kinetics, and the focus here is on understanding how these factors work in the intact cellular environment. The intracellular [Ca] ([Ca]i) and intra-SR [Ca] ([Ca]SR) are two of the most important dynamic modulators of SR Ca release. Indeed, while [Ca]i (and Ca current which initiates systolic SR Ca release) is widely acknowledged to be important, it is increasingly clear that [Ca]SR changes dynamically under physiological conditions and that this has very important regulatory effects on the SR Ca release process. While elevation of [Ca]SR obviously increases the driving force and amount of SR Ca available for release, it also increases the fractional release and can be responsible for spontaneous diastolic SR Ca release. These issues are discussed in both normal physiological and pathophysiological contexts.},

	Abstract = {While a pathway for Ca2+ accumulation into mitochondria has long been established, its functional significance is only now becoming clear in relation to cell physiology and pathophysiology. The observation that mitochondria take up Ca2+ during physiological Ca2+ signalling in a variety of cell types leads to four questions: (i) &apos;What is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on mitochondrial function?&apos; (ii) &apos;What is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on Ca2+ signalling?&apos; (iii) &apos;What are the consequences of impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for cell function?&apos; and finally (iv) &apos;What are the consequences of pathological [Ca2+]c signalling for mitochondrial function?&apos; These will be addressed in turn. Thus: (i) accumulation of Ca2+ into mitochondria regulates mitochondrial metabolism and causes a transient depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential. (ii) Mitochondria may act as a spatial Ca2+ buffer in many cells, regulating the local Ca2+ concentration in cellular microdomains. This process regulates processes dependent on local cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c), particularly the flux of Ca2+ through IP3-gated channels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the channels mediating capacitative Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. Consequently, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a substantial role in shaping [Ca2+]c signals in many cell types. (iii) Impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake alters the spatiotemporal characteristics of cellular [Ca2+]c signalling and downregulates mitochondrial metabolism. (iv) Under pathological conditions of cellular [Ca2+]c overload, particularly in association with oxidative stress, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may trigger pathological states that lead to cell death. In the model of glutamate excitotoxicity, microdomains of [Ca2+]c are apparently central, as the pathway to cell death seems to require the local activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), itself held by scaffolding proteins in close association with the NMDA receptor. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in combination with NO production triggers the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, culminating in delayed cell death.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+) signals mediate the hepatic effects of numerous hormones and growth factors. Hepatic Ca(2+) signals are elicited by the inositol trisphosphate receptor, an intracellular Ca(2+) channel. Three isoforms of this receptor have been identified; they are expressed and regulated differently. We investigated the effect of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis on the hepatic expression of the inositol trisphosphate receptor isoforms. Two different rat models were used: bile duct ligation (fibrosis) and chronic exposure to CCl(4)/phenobarbital (cirrhosis). Messenger RNA levels were determined by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by Southern blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR. Protein expression was assessed by Western blotting; tissue distribution was assessed by immunohistology. In control animals, isoform 2 was the predominant isoform, isoform 1 represented less than one third, and isoform 3 less than 1%. After bile duct ligation, expression of types 1 and 3 increased 1.9- and 5.7-fold, and expression of type 2 decreased 2. 5-fold at the protein level. After exposure to CCl(4)/phenobarbital, expression of types 1, 2, and 3 were 2.4-, 0.9-, and 4.2-fold their expression in control animals. Type 2 was localized to the apical domain of hepatocytes, consistent with a role for Ca(2+) signals in canalicular function. Type 3 was detectable in intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells and not in hepatocytes, suggesting that Ca(2+) signals may be regulated differently in these cells. Signaling through inositol trisphosphate receptor participates in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis, because this process affects the expression of its isoforms.},

Such waves can be accounted for by most realistic models for Ca2+ oscillations taking diffusion of cytosolic Ca2+ into account, but their initiation requires rather demanding and unphysiological initial conditions. Here, it is shown by means of numerical simulations that these spiral Ca2+ waves naturally arise if the cytoplasm is assumed to be heterogeneous both at the level of the synthesis and metabolism of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] and at the level of the distribution of the Ins(1,4, 5)P3 receptors. In such conditions, a spiral can be initiated in the simulations after an increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration, with the direction of rotation being determined by the position of the region of high receptor density with respect to the locus of Ins(1,4, 5)P3 production.},

	Abstract = {Cytosolic Ca2+ waves occur in a number of cell types either spontaneously or after stimulation by hormones, neurotransmitters, or treatments promoting Ca2+ influx into the cells. These waves can be broadly classified into two types. Waves of type 1, observed in cardiac myocytes or Xenopus oocytes, correspond to the propagation of sharp bands of Ca2+ throughout the cell at a rate that is high enough to permit the simultaneous propagation of several fronts in a given cells. Waves of type 2, observed in hepatocytes, endothelial cells, or various kinds of eggs, correspond to the progressive elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ throughout the cell, followed by its quasi-homogeneous return down to basal levels. Here we analyze the propagation of these different types of intracellular Ca2+ waves in a model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). The model accounts for transient or sustained waves of type 1 or 2, depending on the size of the cell and on the values of the kinetic parameters that measure Ca2+ exchange between the cytosol, the extracellular medium, and intracellular stores. Two versions of the model based on CICR are considered. The first version involves two distinct Ca2+ pools sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+, respectively, whereas the second version involves a single pool sensitive both to Ca2+ and IP3 behaving as co-agonists for Ca2+ release. Intracellular Ca2+ waves occur in the two versions of the model based on CICR, but fail to propagate in the one-pool model at subthreshold levels of IP3. For waves of type 1, we investigate the effect of the spatial distribution of Ca(2+)-sensitive Ca2+ stores within the cytosol, and show that the wave fails to propagate when the distance between the stores exceeds a critical value on the order of a few microns. We also determine how the period and velocity of the waves are affected by changes in parameters measuring stimulation, Ca2+ influx into the cell, or Ca2+ pumping into the stores. For waves of type 2, the numerical analysis indicates that the best qualitative agreement with experimental observations is obtained for phase waves. Finally, conditions are obtained for the occurrence of &quot;echo&quot; waves that are sometimes observed in the experiments.},

The dimerization process can lead to crosstalk between the protomers and can result in cooperative binding of ligands to these protomers. However, many results suggest that the crosstalk between protomers within a dimer is not permanent. Receptors oscillate between two states: one that enables binding sites to crosstalk and another that does not enable such crosstalk. In this article, the consequences of the equilibrium between these two states on the binding properties of a receptor are analyzed using the predictions of two mathematical models.},

The model includes sodium and chloride channels in the apical membrane, a Na/K pump and a cotransport system for Cl- with stoichiometry Na+:K+:2Cl- in the basolateral membrane. Potassium channels in the basolateral membrane are used to regulate cell volume. Membrane potentials, ion fluxes and intracellular ion concentration are calculated as functions of apical ion permeabilities, the maximum pump current and the cotransport parameters. The major predictions of the model are: (1) Cl- concentration in the cell is determined entirely by the intracellular concentration of negatively charged impermeable ions and the osmotic conditions; (2) changes in intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations are inversely related; (3) cotransport provides the major driving force for Cl- flux, increases intracellular Na+ concentration, decreases intracellular K+ concentration and hyperpolarizes the cell interior; (4) the maximum rate of the Na/K pump, by contrast, has little effect on Na+ or Cl- transepithelial fluxes and a much less pronounced effect on cell membrane polarization; (5) an increase in apical Na+ permeability causes an increase in intracellular Na+ concentration and a significant increase in Na+ flux; (6) an increase in apical Cl- permeability decreases intracellular Na+ concentration and Na+ flux; (7) assuming Na+ and Cl- permeabilities equal to those measured in human nasal epithelia, the model predicts that under short circuit conditions, Na+ absorption is much higher than Cl- secretion, in agreement with experimental measurements.},

	Abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are transmembrane oligomeric proteins that mediate interconversions between open and closed channel states under the control of neurotransmitters. Fast in vitro chemical kinetics and in vivo electrophysiological recordings are consistent with the following multi-step scheme. Upon binding of agonists, receptor molecules in the closed but activatable resting state (the Basal state, B) undergo rapid transitions to states of higher affinities with either open channels (the Active state, A) or closed channels (the initial Inactivatable and fully Desensitized states, I and D). In order to represent the functional properties of such receptors, we have developed a kinetic model that links conformational interconversion rates to agonist binding and extends the general principles of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric transitions. The crucial assumption is that the linkage is controlled by the position of the interconversion transition states on a hypothetical linear reaction coordinate. Application of the model to the peripheral nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) accounts for the main properties of ligand-gating, including single-channel events, and several new relationships are predicted. Kinetic simulations reveal errors inherent in using the dose-response analysis, but justify its application under defined conditions. The model predicts that (in order to overcome the intrinsic stability of the B state and to produce the appropriate cooperativity) channel activation is driven by an A state with a Kd in the 50 nM range, hence some 140-fold stronger than the apparent affinity of the open state deduced previously. According to the model, recovery from the desensitized states may occur via rapid transit through the A state with minimal channel opening, thus without necessarily undergoing a distinct recovery pathway, as assumed in the standard &apos;cycle&apos; model. Transitions to the desensitized states by low concentration &apos;pre-pulses&apos; are predicted to occur without significant channel opening, but equilibrium values of IC50 can be obtained only with long pre-pulse times. Predictions are also made concerning allosteric effectors and their possible role in coincidence detection. In terms of future developments, the analysis presented here provides a physical basis for constructing more biologically realistic models of synaptic modulation that may be applied to artificial neural networks.},

Both rPMCA2a and rPMCA2b had a much higher affinity for calmodulin than the corresponding forms of hPMCA4, and rPMCA2b had the highest affinity among the isoforms that have been tested so far. When analyzed at a relatively high calmodulin concentration, rPMCA2b and, to a lesser extent, rPMCA2a showed higher apparent calcium affinity; i.e. they were more active at lower Ca2+ concentrations than hPMCA4b. This indicates that these two variants of rat isoform 2 will tend to maintain a lower free cytosolic Ca2+ level in cells where they are expressed. Both variants also showed a higher level of basal activity (in the complete absence of calmodulin) than hPMCA4b, a property which would reinforce their ability to maintain a low free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Experiments designed to determine the source of the higher apparent Ca2+ affinity of rPMCA2b showed that it came from the properties of the carboxyl terminus, rather than from any difference in the catalytic core.},

To understand these processes better, we monitored calcium transients in axons and presynaptic terminals of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slice cultures. Action potentials reliably evoke calcium transients in axons and boutons. Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from internal stores contributes to the transients in boutons and to paired-pulse facilitation of EPSPs. Store depletion activates store-operated calcium channels, influencing the frequency of spontaneous transmitter release. Boutons display spontaneous Ca^2^+ transients; blocking CICR reduces the frequency of these transients and of spontaneous miniature synaptic events. Thus, spontaneous transmitter release is largely calcium mediated, driven by Ca^2^+ release from internal stores. Bouton store release is important for short-term synaptic plasticity and may also contribute to long-term plasticity.},

Conductance-based models of pyloric neurons typically fail to reproduce the observed irregular behavior in either voltage time series or state-space trajectories. Recent suggestions of Chay [Biol Cybern 75: 419-431] indicate that chaotic bursting patterns can be generated by model neurons that couple membrane currents to the nonlinear dynamics of intracellular calcium storage and release. Accordingly, we have built a two-compartment model of a pyloric CPG neuron incorporating previously described membrane conductances together with intracellular Ca2+ dynamics involving the endoplasmic reticulum and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor IP3R. As judged by qualitative inspection and quantitative, nonlinear analysis, the irregular voltage oscillations of the model neuron resemble those seen in the biological neurons. Chaotic bursting arises from the interaction of fast membrane voltage dynamics with slower intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and, hence, depends on the concentration of IP3. Despite the presence of 12 independent dynamical variables, the model neuron bursts chaotically in a subspace characterized by 3-4 active degrees of freedom. The critical aspect of this model is that chaotic oscillations arise when membrane voltage processes are coupled to another slow dynamic. Here we suggest this slow dynamic to be intracellular Ca2+ handling.},

Here we examine these experimental findings by modeling Ca(2+) release using a modified Othmer-Tang-model. An increase in the period and a reduction in the amplitude of Ca(2+) wave activity are obtained when increases in SERCA density are simulated while keeping all other parameters of the model constant. However, Ca(2+) wave period can be reduced and the wave amplitude and velocity can be significantly increased when an increase in the luminal ER Ca(2+) concentration due to SERCA overexpression is incorporated into the model. Increased luminal Ca(2+) occurs because increased SERCA activity lowers cytosolic Ca(2+), which is partially replenished by Ca(2+) influx across the plasma membrane. These simulations are supported by experimental data demonstrating higher luminal Ca(2+) levels, decreased periods, increased amplitude, and increased velocity of Ca(2+) waves in response to increased SERCA density.},

This model integrates the electrical and osmotic behaviors of the epithelium, taking into account intracellular conditions. The specific tissue modeled is the human bronchial epithelium, which is of particular interest, as it is the location of the most common lethal symptoms of cystic fibrosis. The model is implemented in a modular form to facilitate future application of the code to other epithelial tissue by inputting different transporters, channels, and geometric parameters. The model includes pH regulation as an integral component of overall regulation of epithelial function, through the interdependence of pH, bicarbonate concentration, and current. The procedures for specification, the validation of the model, and parametric studies are presented using available experimental data of cultured human bronchial epithelium. Parametric studies are performed to elucidate a), the contribution of basolateral chloride channels to the short-circuit current functional form, and b), the role that regulation of basolateral potassium conductance plays in epithelial function.},

In this study, we present a mathematical model of the transmembrane ion flows and intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics from a single ICC pacemaker unit acting at near-resting membrane potential. This model quantitatively formalizes the framework of a novel ICC pacemaking mechanism that has recently been proposed. Model simulations produce spontaneously rhythmic UP depolarizations with an amplitude of approximately 3 mV at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. The model predicts that the main inward currents, carried by a Ca(2+)-inhibited nonselective cation conductance, are activated by depletion of sub-plasma-membrane [Ca(2+)] caused by sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase Ca(2+) sequestration. Furthermore, pacemaker activity predicted by our model persists under simulated voltage clamp and is independent of [IP(3)] oscillations. The model presented here provides a basis to quantitatively analyze UP depolarizations and the biophysical mechanisms underlying their production.},

	Abstract = {Net Ca2+ uptake into intracellular Ca2+ stores of homogenized cells is transient, even when the extravesicular Ca2+ concentration is kept constant. To study the mechanism underlying the phenomenon, we have investigated 45Ca2+ uptake by HL-60 cell homogenates. The initial rate of Ca2+ uptake as well as the final amount of stored Ca2+ were a function of the extravesicular Ca2+ concentration. However, Ca2+ uptake stopped independently of the extravesicular Ca2+ concentration after approximately 10 min. Studies using Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors demonstrated that the transient nature of the net uptake was not due to Ca2+ efflux. Monovalent cation ionophores did not influence the Ca2+ uptake curves, excluding a relevant involvement of pH and membrane potential. Together with the observation of a continued Ca2+ uptake in the presence of the intralumenal Ca2+ chelator oxalate, these results strongly suggest a feedback inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by the Ca2+ load of intracellular stores. The concentration-inhibition relationship between the Ca2+ load and the rate of Ca2+ uptake was highly supralinear (slope factor &gt;/= 4). IC50 and maximum of the dose-inhibition curve, but not the slope factor were a function of the extravesicular free Ca2+ concentration. A series of three logistic equations derived from our data allowed an appropriate description of the behavior of Ca2+ uptake. Our results suggest, in addition to its well known activation by cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, a highly supralinear feedback inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by the Ca2+ load of intracellular stores. The steepness of the feedback inhibition might have a profound effect on spatial and temporal behavior of the Ca2+ signal.},

From these experiments, the [InsP&quot;3]&quot;c&quot;y&quot;t required to evoke a half-maximal calcium response is 100 nM. Experiments with caged glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (GPIP&quot;2), a slowly metabolized analogue of InsP&quot;3, gave a much slower recovery and a half-maximal response of an order of magnitude greater than InsP&quot;3. Experimental data and highly constrained variables were used to construct a mathematical model of the InsP&quot;3-dependent [Ca^2^+]&quot;c&quot;y&quot;t changes; the resulting simulations show high fidelity to experiment. Among the elements considered in constructing this model were the mechanism of the InsP&quot;3-receptor, InsP&quot;3 degradation, calcium buffering in the cytosol, and refilling of the ER stores via sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The model predicts a time constant of 0.8s for InsP&quot;3 degradation and 13s for GPIP&quot;2. InsP&quot;3 degradation was found to be a prerequisite for [Ca^2^+]&quot;c&quot;y&quot;t recovery to baseline levels and is therefore critical to the pattern of the overall [Ca^2^+]&quot;c&quot;y&quot;t signal. Analysis of the features of this model provides insights into the individual factors controlling the amplitude and shape of the InsP&quot;3-mediated calcium signal.},

	Abstract = {InsP(3)-evoked elementary Ca(2+) release events have been postulated to play a role in providing the building blocks of larger Ca(2+) signals. In pancreatic acinar cells, low concentrations of acetylcholine or the injection of low concentrations of InsP(3) elicit a train of spatially localized Ca(2+) spikes. In this study we have quantified these responses and compared the Ca(2+) signals to the elementary events shown in Xenopus oocytes. The results demonstrate, at the same concentrations of InsP(3), Ca(2+) signals consisting of one population of small transient Ca(2+) release events and a second distinct population of larger Ca(2+) spikes. The signal mass amplitudes of both types of events are within the range of amplitudes for the elementary events in Xenopus oocytes. However, the bimodal Ca(2+) distribution of Ca(2+) responses we observe is not consistent with the continuum of event sizes seen in Xenopus. We conclude that the two types of InsP(3)-dependent events in acinar cells are both elementary Ca(2+) signals, which are independent of one another. Our data indicate a complexity to the organization of the Ca(2+) release apparatus in acinar cells, which might result from the presence of multiple InsP(3) receptor isoforms, and is likely to be important in the physiology of these cells.},

	Abstract = {Nonlinear Scatchard plots are often found for agonist binding to G-protein-coupled receptors. Because there is clear evidence of receptor dimerization, these nonlinear Scatchard plots can reflect cooperativity on agonist binding to the two binding sites in the dimer. According to this, the &quot;two-state dimer receptor model&quot; has been recently derived. In this article, the performance of the model has been analyzed in fitting data of agonist binding to A(1) adenosine receptors, which are an example of receptor displaying concave downward Scatchard plots. Analysis of agonist/antagonist competition data for dopamine D(1) receptors using the two-state dimer receptor model has also been performed. Although fitting to the two-state dimer receptor model was similar to the fitting to the &quot;two-independent-site receptor model&quot;, the former is simpler, and a discrimination test selects the two-state dimer receptor model as the best. This model was also very robust in fitting data of estrogen binding to the estrogen receptor, for which Scatchard plots are concave upward. On the one hand, the model would predict the already demonstrated existence of estrogen receptor dimers. On the other hand, the model would predict that concave upward Scatchard plots reflect positive cooperativity, which can be neither predicted nor explained by assuming the existence of two different affinity states. In summary, the two-state dimer receptor model is good for fitting data of binding to dimeric receptors displaying either linear, concave upward, or concave downward Scatchard plots.},

It has become well established, for example, that muscle length is equilibrated dynamically rather than statically, and that non-classical features of muscle biophysics come to the forefront, including unanticipated interactions between the muscle and its time-varying load, as well as the ability of the muscle cell to adapt rapidly to changes in its dynamic microenvironment.

We then examined the relationships between the presence of cardioventilatory coupling in these epochs and the plot appearance and entropy measures derived from these plots. We observed that coupling was significantly associated with the presence of banding in the raw heart rate and RR consecutive difference time series, and with discrete clustering within the RR consecutive difference phase portrait. A significant correlation was found between coupling and the entropy of the RR consecutive difference time series and its phase portrait.

The pros and cons of mathematical models are examined with special emphasis given to the interpretation of the connection between the shapes of the curves and receptor cooperativity.

Our data, from both cell types, suggest that natriuretic peptides modulate the frequency of [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations through alterations in plasma membrane Ca(2+) fluxes. Here, we review evidence for a role for plasma membrane Ca(2+) fluxes in the control of the frequency of [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations. We describe a hypothetical mechanism through which this might be achieved. We propose a physiological role for regulated control of Ca(2+) efflux in modulating [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Investigating how calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is triggered and coordinated is crucial to our understanding of how oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPs) develop into myelinating cells. Sparks and puffs represent highly localized Ca(2+) release from the ER through ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs), respectively. To study whether sparks or puffs trigger Ca(2+) waves in OPs, we performed rapid high-resolution line scan recordings in fluo-4-loaded OP processes. We found spontaneous and evoked sparks and puffs, and we have identified functional cross talk between IP(3)Rs and RyRs. Local events evoked using the IP(3)-linked agonist methacholine (MeCh) showed significantly different morphology compared with events evoked using the caffeine analog 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX). Pretreatment with MeCh potentiated DMPX-evoked events, whereas inhibition of RyRs potentiated events evoked by low concentrations of MeCh. Furthermore, activation of IP(3)Rs but not RyRs was critical for Ca(2+) wave initiation. Using immunocytochemistry, we show OPs express the specific Ca(2+) release channel subtypes RyR3 and IP(3)R2 in patches along OP processes. RyRs are coexpressed with IP(3)Rs in some patches, but IP(3)Rs are also found alone. This differential distribution pattern may underlie the differences in local and global Ca(2+) signals mediated by these two receptors. Thus, in OPs, interactions between IP(3)Rs and RyRs determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of calcium signaling, from microdomains to intracellular waves.},

	Abstract = {Allosteric modulation is a mechanism for modifying pharmacological receptor activity that has largely been ignored in terms of therapeutic drug design, although benzodiazepine receptor ligands are an example of the serendipitous discovery of this class of compound. The current mathematical models of allosteric interactions at (particularly G-protein-coupled) receptors concentrate on the effects of the allosteric ligand on orthosteric ligand binding and ignore potential effects of these compounds on the ability of orthosteric ligands to cause receptor activation. In this report a mathematical model of allosteric interactions at pharmacological receptors has been investigated that explicitly includes effects of the allosteric ligand on receptor activation. This model uses the two-state model of receptor activation as its basis and is qualitatively consistent with currently reported behavior of allosteric modulators. The predictions of this model suggest a series of criteria that should be tested before the effects of an allosteric modulator can be quantified in a nonsystem-dependent manner. It has also been used to provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the functional effects of the A(1) adenosine receptor allosteric enhancer PD 81,723 and a recently reported allosteric modulator of type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors.},

At 20 degrees C and pH 7.1, in a cytosol-like medium containing MgCl2, the half-time for InsP3 dissociation was as short as 125 ms.

Various modulators of InsP3 binding (KCl, NaCl, pH, Mg2+, and Ca2+) were found to affect the receptor&apos;s apparent affinity for InsP3 mainly by altering the rate constant for [3H]InsP3 dissociation. ATP (but not InsP3) also accelerated [3H]InsP3 dissociation. In contrast to these modulators, luminal Ca2+ was found to have no effect on the amount of microsome-bound [3H]InsP3.},

	Abstract = {cADP-ribose (cADPr) and nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) are two putative second messengers; they were first shown to stimulate Ca(2+) mobilization in sea urchin eggs. We have used the patch-clamp whole-cell technique to determine the role of cADPr and NAADP in relation to that of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) in mouse submandibular acinar cells by measuring agonist-evoked and second-messenger-evoked changes in Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) and Cl(-) currents. Both Ins(1,4,5)P(3) and cADPr were capable of reproducing the full range of responses normally seen in response to stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh). Low concentrations of agonist (10-20 nM ACh) or second messenger [1-10 microM Ins(1,4,5)P(3) or cADPr] elicited a sporadic transient activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent currents; mid-range concentrations [50-500 nM ACh, 50 microM Ins(1,4,5)P(3) or 50-100 microM cADPr] elicited high-frequency (approx. 2 Hz) trains of current spikes; and high concentrations [more than 500 nM ACh, more than 50 microM Ins(1,4,5)P(3) or more than 100 microM cADPr] gave rise to a sustained current response. The response to ACh was inhibited by antagonists of both the Ins(1,4,5)P(3) receptor [Ins(1,4,5)P(3)R] and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) but could be completely blocked only by an Ins(1,4,5)P(3)R antagonist (heparin). NAADP (50 nM to 100 microM) did not itself activate the Ca(2+)-dependent ion currents, nor did it inhibit the activation of these currents by ACh. These results show that, in these cells, both Ins(1,4,5)P(3)R and RyR are involved in the propagation of the Ca(2+) signal stimulated by ACh and that cADPr can function as an endogenous regulator of RyR. Furthermore, although NAADP might have a role in hormone-stimulated secretion in pancreatic acinar cells, it does not contribute to ACh-evoked secretion in submandibular acinar cells.},

However, &quot;local&quot; Ca(2+) signals, that are restricted to the apical pole of the cell, have been previously demonstrated only in pancreatic acinar cells in which the primary function of the Ca(2+) signal is to regulate exocytosis. We show that submandibular acinar cells, in which the primary function of the Ca(2+) signal is to drive fluid and electrolyte secretion, are capable of both Ca(2+) waves and local Ca(2+) signals. The generally accepted model for fluid and electrolyte secretion requires simultaneous Ca(2+)-activation of basally located K(+) channels and apically located Cl(-) channels. Whereas a propagated cell-wide Ca(2+) signal is clearly consistent with this model, a local Ca(2+) signal is not, because there is no increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration at the basal pole of the cell. Our data provide the first direct demonstration, in submandibular acinar cells, of the apical and basal location of the Cl(-) and K(+) channels, respectively, and confirm that local Ca(2+) signals do not Ca(2+)-activate K(+) channels. We reevaluate the model for fluid and electrolyte secretion and demonstrate that Ca(2+)-activation of the Cl(-) channels is sufficient to voltage-activate the K(+) channels and thus demonstrate that local Ca(2+) signals are sufficient to support fluid secretion.},

PF stimulation (1 Hz), at relatively high stimulus strengths, led to accumulations of calcium that were similar in peak levels to those following CF stimulation but that remained spatially localized. Such stimuli consistently induced a durable depression of PF synaptic transmission that partially occluded further depression by conventional conjunctive stimuli and that was independent of nitric oxide. This depression was accompanied by a reduction of synaptic efficacy in spatially isolated PF inputs to the same cell that was independent of postsynaptic calcium but that was mediated by nitric oxide. These data indicate that LTD comprises at least two separate processes and that parameters of PF stimulation that are capable of raising calcium levels in Purkinje cell dendrites are also able to induce long-term changes in synaptic efficacy.},

	Abstract = {Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is classically observed when climbing fibers, originating from the inferior olive, and parallel fibers, axons of granule cells, are activated repetitively and synchronously. On the basis that the climbing fiber signals errors in motor performance, LTD provides a mechanism of learning whereby inappropriate motor signals, relayed to the cerebellar cortex by parallel fibers, are selectively weakened through their repeated, close temporal association with climbing fiber activity. LTD therefore provides a cellular substrate for error-driven motor learning in the cerebellar cortex. In recent years, it has become apparent that depression at this synapse can also occur without the need for concurrent climbing fiber activation provided the parallel fibers are activated in such a way as to mobilize calcium within the Purkinje cell. A form of long-term potentiation (LTP) has also been uncovered at this synapse, which similarly relies only upon parallel fiber activation. In brain slice preparations and contrary to expectation, each of these forms of parallel fiber induced plasticity, as well as classical LTD, does not remain confined to activated parallel fibers as previously thought, but both depression and potentiation have the capacity to spread to neighboring parallel fiber synapses several tens of microns away from the activated fibers. Here, the cellular mechanisms responsible for the induction and heterosynaptic spread of parallel fiber LTP and LTD are compared to those involved in classical LTD and the physiological implications that the heterosynaptic spread of plasticity may have on cerebellar signal processing are discussed.},

Model variables included cell [Na], [K], [Cl], volume, and membrane potentials. The model contained apical membrane Cl, Na, and K conductances, basolateral membrane K conductance, Na/K/2 Cl and Na/Cl symport, and 3 Na/2 K ATPase, and a paracellular conductance. Transporter permeabilities and ion saturabilities were determined from reported ion flux data and membrane potentials in intact canine trachea. Without additional assumptions, the model predicted accurately the measured short-circuit current (Isc), cellular conductances, voltage-divider ratios, open-circuit potentials, and the time course of cell ion composition in ion substitution experiments. The model was used to examine quantitatively: (a) the effect of transport inhibitors on Isc and membrane potentials, (b) the dual role of apical Cl and basolateral K conductance in cell secretion, (c) whether the basolateral symporter requires K, and (d) the regulation of apical Cl conductance by cAMP and Ca-dependent signaling pathways. Model predictions gave improved understanding of the interrelations among transporting systems and in many cases gave surprising predictions that were not obvious without a detailed model. The model developed here has direct application to secretory or absorptive epithelial cells in the kidney thick ascending limb, cornea, sweat duct, and intestine in normal and pathophysiological states such as cystic fibrosis and cholera.},

	Abstract = {1. The properties of glutamate receptor (GluR) channels in outside-out patches from the dendrites and somata of rat cerebellar Purkinje cells in brain slice were studied using fast agonist application techniques. Dendritic patches were isolated 40-130 micronm from the soma. 2. Outside-out patches from both dendrites and somata of Purkinje cells responded to application of glutamate with a current which desensitized rapidly and nearly completely. Currents evoked by glutamate application were blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), were mimicked by L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), and were modulated by cyclothiazide. Kainate produced small, non-desensitizing currents. No currents were observed in response to aspartate application. Responses characteristic of NMDA receptor activation were not observed. These findings indicate that glutamate-activated currents were mediated by the AMPA subtype of GluR. 3. Deactivation of the GluR channels following 1 ms pulses of glutamate occurred with a time constant of 1.23 +/- 0.07 ms in dendritic and 1.12 +/- 0.04 ms in somatic patches. Desensitization occurred with a time constant of 5.37 +/- 0.26 ms in dendritic and 5.29 +/- 0.29 ms in somatic patches. The time constant of recovery from desensitization caused by a 1 ms application of 1 mM glutamate was 36 ms in dendritic patches and 33 ms in somatic patches. 4. Half-maximal activation of the GluR channels was achieved at a glutamate concentration of 432 microM. Deactivation kinetics were not dependent on the glutamate concentration, while desensitization became slower at lower glutamate concentrations. 5. Pre-equilibration of patches with low concentrations of glutamate reduced the peak current activated by 1 mM glutamate. The IC50 for this effect was 8.7 microM. Equilibrium desensitization did not affect the kinetics of the current activated by 1 mM glutamate. 6. The current-voltage relationship of the peak current was linear in normal Na(+)-rich external solution, with a reversal potential near 0 mV. In Ca(2+) -rich external solution, the reversal potentials were -51.4 +/- 2.9 and -51.5 +/- 2.8 mV for dendritic and somatic patches, respectively, indicating that these glutamate channels have a low permeability to Ca2+ (PCa/PCa = 0.053). 7. The mean single-channel conductance of the GluR channels measured using non-stationary fluctuation analysis was approximately 8 pS in dendritic and somatic patches, and the maximum open probability was at least 0.7 with 5 mM glutamate. 8. GluR channel kinetics in patches excised from the soma of neonatal (postnatal day 4; P4) Purkinje cells, before the development of the dendritic arborization of the Purkinje cell, were similar to those in patches excised from more mature (P12-18) Purkinje cells. 9. Dendritic and somatic GluR channels in Purkinje cells appear to be functionally identical, are AMPA-subtype receptors containing the GluR-B subunit, and have rapid kinetics and low permeability to Ca2+. A kinetic model was constructed which faithfully reproduces the gating characteristics of the GluR channels.},

The potentiation by Ca2+ of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ release was studied by measuring luminal Ca2+ concentrations of the Ca2+ stores using a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, furaptra, in permeabilized smooth muscle cells. 2. Ca2+ release at 10 microM IP3 was potentiated by an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in the presence of 10 mM EGTA. This effect was not due to the pharmacological effect of EGTA, because changes in the EGTA concentration at a constant Ca2+ concentration had no effect on the Ca2+ release rate. 3. With an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration from 30 to 630 nM, the Ca2+ release rate at a saturating IP3 concentration increased 110-fold and the EC50 for IP3 increased from 0.07 to 1.0 microM. It was also indicated that the relationship between Ca2+ concentration and Ca2+ release rate was shifted towards higher Ca2+ concentrations at higher IP3 concentrations. 4. These results suggest that IP3 and submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ allosterically lower the affinity of the IP3 receptor for each other and are both required for IP3 receptor activation. These properties enable the IP3 receptors to detect simultaneous increases in IP3 and Ca2+ concentrations.},

	Abstract = {Under resting conditions, steady-state [Ca] in agonist-sensitive Ca stores reflects a balance between active uptake (usually mediated by a thapsigargin-sensitive Ca-ATPase of the SERCA family) and passive efflux of Ca. Even though this pump-leak cycle appears to be a common property of Ca-storing organelles, little is known about the nature of the leak pathway. Ca homeostasis in thapsigargin-sensitive internal Ca stores of single permeabilized BHK-21 fibroblasts was examined using digital image processing of compartmentalized mag-fura-2 (a low-affinity Ca indicator). It is shown here that the leak of Ca from internal stores is regulated specifically by the cytosolic ATP concentration. The rate of leak was 3.6 times slower in 0.375 mM[ATP] than in 4 mM [ATP] (Na or Mg salt). These effects were observed in the presence of 0 Ca/EGTA, thapsigargin, heparin, and ruthenium red, and therefore appear to be independent of the Ca-ATPase, the InsP(3) receptor and the ryanodine receptor. The ATP-stimulated leak was seen in a variety of cell types, including rat basophilic leukemia cells and mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Other nucleotides (ADP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMP-PNP and ATPgammaS) did not reproduce the action of ATP. Changes in cellular metabolism and ensuing alterations in [ATP] will be expected to influence the filling state of internal Ca stores through effects on the passive leak pathway, potentially leading to modulation of Ca signaling and organellar function.},

	Abstract = {Activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) by calmodulin following calcium entry into the cell is important for long-term potentiation (LTP). Here a model of calmodulin binding and trapping by CaMKII in a dendritic spine was used to estimate levels and durations of CaMKII activation following LTP-inducing tetani. The calcium signal was calcium influx through NMDA receptor channels computed in a highly detailed dentate granule cell model. Calcium could bind to calmodulin and calmodulin to CaMKII. CaMKII subunits were either free, bound with calmodulin, trapped, autonomous, or capped. Strong low-frequency tetanic input produced little calmodulin trapping or CaMKII activation. Strong high-frequency tetanic input caused large numbers of CaMKII subunits to become trapped, and CaMKII was strongly activated. Calmodulin trapping and CaMKII activation were highly dependent on tetanus frequency (particularly between 10 and 100 Hz) and were highly sensitive to relatively small changes in the calcium signal. Repetition of a short high-frequency tetanus was necessary to achieve high levels of CaMKII activation. Three stages of CaMKII activation were found in the model: a short, highly activated stage; an intermediate, moderately active stage; and a long-lasting third stage, whose duration depended on dephosphorylation rates but whose decay rate was faster at low CaMKII activation levels than at high levels. It is not clear which of these three stages is most important for LTP.},

To understand this diversity, we use two-photon imaging of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal cells and measure action potential-evoked [Ca^2^+]&quot;i transients in spines. Spine calcium kinetics are controlled by (i) the diameter of the parent dendrite, (ii) the length of the spine neck, and (iii) the strength of spine calcium pumps. These factors produce different calcium dynamics in spines from basal, proximal apical, and distal apical dendrites, differences that are more pronounced without exogenous buffers. In proximal and distal apical dendrites, different calcium dynamics correlate with different susceptibility to synaptic depression, and modifying calcium kinetics in spines changes the expression of long-term depression. Thus, the spine location apparently determines its calcium dynamics and synaptic plasticity. Our results highlight the precision in design of neocortical neurons.},

In this system, the apparent dimerization constant and the apparent molecular weight are functions of free ligand concentration, and depend on the intrinsic binding constants of the ligand molecule to the monomer and the dimer. The behavior of these functions is classified into 17 cases according to the values of the three intrinsic binding constants, and some calculated examples are shown graphically for selected parameters. The theory was also applied to D-amino acid oxidase [EC 1.4.3.3], a flavoprotein, and the pH dependence of the apparent dimerization constant and the apparent molecular weight in the presence of ligand, p-aminobenzoate, were studied theoretically using parameters obtained in our previous experiments (5).},

	Abstract = {After the seminal work of Ebashi and coworkers which established the essential role of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction, we have witnessed an explosive elongation of the list of cell functions that are controlled by the [Ca2+]i. In numerous instances, release of intracellular Ca2+ stores plays important roles in Ca2+ signalling which displays significant variation in spatio-temporal pattern. There are two families of Ca2+ release channels, ryanodine receptors and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors. These Ca2+ release channels are structurally and functionally similar. In particular, the activity of both types of channels is regulated by the [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i dependence of the Ca2+ release channel activity provides both types of channels with properties of a Ca2+ signal amplifier. This function of the ryanodine receptor is important in striated muscle excitation-contraction coupling, whereas that of the IP3 receptor seems to be the basis of the generation of Ca2+ waves. Thus the wide variety of Ca2+ signalling patterns seem to be critically dependent on the [Ca2+]i dependence of the Ca2+ release channels.},

Direct measurements of binding at various Ca(2+) concentrations demonstrate that site-directed mutations within this region interfere selectively with Ca(2+) occupancy of either one or both binding sites and with the cooperative character of the binding isotherms. A transition associated with high affinity and cooperative binding of the second Ca(2+) and the engagement of N796 and E309 are both required to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate with ATP in the forward direction of the cycle and also to form ATP from phosphoenzyme intermediate and ADP in the reverse direction of the cycle. This transition, defined by equilibrium and kinetic characterization of the partial reactions of the enzyme cycle, extends from transmembrane helices to the catalytic site through a long-range linkage and is the mechanistic device for interconversion of binding and phosphorylation potentials.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms of agonist-induced Ca(2+) spikes have been investigated using a caged inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and a low-affinity Ca(2+) indicator, BTC, in pancreatic acinar cells. Rapid photolysis of caged IP(3) was able to reproduce acetylcholine (ACh)-induced three forms of Ca(2+) spikes: local Ca(2+) spikes and submicromolar (&lt;1 microM) and micromolar (1-15 microM) global Ca(2+) spikes (Ca(2+) waves). These observations indicate that subcellular gradients of IP(3) sensitivity underlie all forms of ACh-induced Ca(2+) spikes, and that the amplitude and extent of Ca(2+) spikes are determined by the concentration of IP(3). IP(3)-induced local Ca(2+) spikes exhibited similar time courses to those generated by ACh, supporting a role for Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release in local Ca(2+) spikes. In contrast, IP(3)- induced global Ca(2+) spikes were consistently faster than those evoked with ACh at all concentrations of IP(3) and ACh, suggesting that production of IP(3) via phospholipase C was slow and limited the spread of the Ca(2+) spikes. Indeed, gradual photolysis of caged IP(3) reproduced ACh-induced slow Ca(2+) spikes. Thus, local and global Ca(2+) spikes involve distinct mechanisms, and the kinetics of global Ca(2+) spikes depends on that of IP(3) production particularly in those cells such as acinar cells where heterogeneity in IP(3) sensitivity plays critical role.},

	Abstract = {In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying excitation of the uterus, we have elucidated the characteristics and functional importance of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents ( I(Cl-Ca)) in pregnant rat myometrium. In 101/320 freshly isolated myocytes, there was a slowly inactivating tail current (162+/-48 pA) upon repolarization following depolarising steps. This current has a reversal potential close to that for chloride, and was shifted when [Cl(-)] was altered. It was activated by Ca(2+) (but not Ba(2+)) entry through L-type Ca(2+) channels, enhanced by the Ca(2+) channel agonist Bay K8644 (2 microM), and inhibited by the Cl(-) channel blockers, niflumic acid (10 microM) and anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AC, 100 microM). We therefore conclude that the pregnant rat myometrium contains Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels producing inward current in ~30% of its cells. When these channels were inhibited by niflumic acid or 9-AC in intact tissues, the frequency of spontaneous contractions, was significantly reduced. Niflumic acid was also shown to inhibit oxytocin-induced contractions and Ca(2+) transients. Neither 9-AC nor niflumic acid had any effect on high-K-invoked contractions. Taken together these data suggest that Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels are activated by Ca(2+) entry and play a functionally important role in myometrium, probably by contributing to membrane potential and firing frequency (pacemakers) in these cells.},

In both HeLa cells and primary cultures of skeletal myotubes, stimulation with agonists evoking cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) signals caused increases in [ATP](m) and [ATP](c) that depended on two parameters: (i) the amplitude of the Ca(2+) rise in the mitochondrial matrix, and (ii) the availability of mitochondrial substrates. Moreover, the Ca(2+) elevation induced a long-lasting priming that persisted long after agonist washout and caused a major increase in [ATP](m) upon addition of oxidative substrates. These results demonstrate a direct role of mitochondrial Ca(2+) in driving ATP production and unravel a form of cellular memory that allows a prolonged metabolic activation in stimulated cells.},

	Abstract = {(1) A mathematical investigation has been made of the progress of an epidemic in a homogeneous population. It has been assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single attack, and that an individual is not infective at the moment at which he receives infection. With these reservations the problem has been investigated in its most general aspects, and the following conclusions have been arrived at. (2) In general a threshold density of population is found to exist, which depends upon the infectivity, recovery and death rates peculiar to the epidemic. No epidemic can occur if the population density is below this threshold value. (3) Small increases of the infectivity rate may lead to large epidemics; also, if the population density slightly exceeds its threshold value the effect of an epidemic will be to reduce the density as far below the threshold value as initially it was above it. (4) An epidemic, in general, comes to an end, before the susceptible population has been exhausted. (5) Similar results are indicated for the case in which transmission is through an intermediate host.},

	Abstract = {The role of Ca2+ in stimulus-response coupling in nonexcitable cells is still not well understood. The Ca2+ responses of individual cells are extremely diverse, often displaying marked oscillations, and almost nothing is known about the specific features of these Ca2+ signals that are important for the functional response of a cell. Using the RBL-2H3 mucosal mast cell as a model, we have studied the temporal relationship between changes in intracellular Ca2+ and serotonin secretion at the single-cell level using simultaneous indo-1 photometry and constant potential amperometry. Secretion in response to antigen never occurs until intracellular Ca2+ is elevated, nor is it seen during the first few oscillations in Ca2+. Exocytotic events tend to be clustered around the peaks of oscillations, but excellent secretion is also seen in cells with sustained elevations in Ca2+. Ca2+ release from stores in the absence of influx fails to elicit secretion. If refilling and continued release of Ca2+ from stores is prevented with thapsigargin, Ca2+ influx can still trigger secretion, suggesting that store-associated microdomains of Ca2+ are not required for exocytosis. Our findings demonstrate the importance of an amplitude-encoded Ca2+ signal and Ca2+ influx for stimulus-secretion coupling in these nonexcitable cells.},

	Abstract = {On the basis of the 3D structures of the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and ErbB3, a mechanism has been proposed for how the extracellular region of the EGFR is maintained in an autoinhibited configuration and for how EGF binding induces EGFR dimerization and activation. We have attempted to derive a mathematical model for EGF binding to the EGFR and for ligand-induced receptor dimerization and activation that uses this structural information and can explain the characteristic concave-up curvilinear Scatchard plots seen when EGF binding to intact EGFR is studied in living cells. We show that these curvilinear plots cannot be accounted for by simply ascribing different affinities to the autoinhibited and extended (dimeric) configurations of the receptor seen in structural studies. Concave-up plots can only be obtained by including in the mathematical model an additional binding event in which occupied EGFR dimers bind to an &quot;external site.&quot; The external site may represent receptor interactions with coated-pit regions in the cell membrane or with other cellular components involved in receptor endocytosis and turnover. We conclude in this study and in the accompanying article that the active extended EGFR configuration binds EGF 5- to 20-fold more strongly than the autoinhibited monomeric receptor configuration. However, these extended receptors do not correspond directly with the &quot;high-affinity&quot; EGF-binding sites seen in EGF-binding studies on intact cells.},

	Abstract = {In vascular endothelial cells, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores elicited capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) that resulted in biphasic changes of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with a rapid initial peak of [Ca2+]i followed by a gradual decrease to a sustained plateau level. We investigated the rates of Ca2+ entry, removal, and sequestration during activation of CCE and their respective contributions to the biphasic changes of [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ buffering by mitochondria, removal by Na+/Ca2+ exchange, and a fixed electrical driving force for Ca2+ (voltage-clamp experiments) had little effect on the CCE signal. The rates of entry of Mn2+ and Ba2+, used as unidirectional substitutes for Ca2+ entry through the CCE pathway, were constant and did not follow the concomitant changes of [Ca2+]i. Pharmacological inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, however, abolished the secondary decay phase of the CCE transient. The disparity between the biphasic changes of [Ca2+]i and the constant rate of Ca2+ entry during CCE was the result of a delayed, Ca(2+)-dependent activation of the pump. These results suggest an important modulatory role of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump in the net cellular gain of Ca2+ during CCE.},

	Abstract = {Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a family of proteins that have seven transmembrane segments and that couple to G proteins. They differ from ionotropic glutamate receptors in that they do not form ion channels but instead affect intracellular chemical messenger systems. Eight genes coding for different subtypes of mGluRs have been identified to date and numbered accordingly in the order in which the cDNAs were cloned. Based on their principal signal-transduction capabilities in recombinant expression systems and sequence similarities, the family of mGluR subtypes is subdivided into three groups. Group 1 mGluRs (consisting of mGluR1 and 5) functionally couple to phospholipase C and affect the IP3/Ca2+ signaling pathway. The subtypes of group 2 (mGluR2 and 3) and group 3 (mGluR4, 6 7 and 8) inhibit adenylate cyclase and, thereby, mediate a decrease in cAMP concentration. All mGluR subtypes are found in the cerebellar cortex with the exception of mGluR6 which is exclusively expressed in the retina. At the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses mGluR1 is localized in the peri- and extra-synaptic membrane of Purkinje cells. The main focus of this review deals with the functions of this postsynaptically localized mGluR1. These functions include (i) mediation of an inward current and a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential, and (ii) a role in induction of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell long-term depression. We discuss the mechanism underlying the mGluR1-mediated postsynaptic current as well as current theories on the role of mGluR1 in parallel fiber-Purkinje cell long-term depression.},

Biol, 56: 459-490, 1994) has been extended by the inclusion of CO2 and H2CO3 as diffusible species and by the inclusion of finite rate constants for the hydration of CO2. This permits the simulation of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity and its inhibition. We confirm the result of our previous study, which is that, in the presence of CA, the unstirred layer has only a modest effect on the observed formic acid permeability. CA inhibition results in disequilibrium pH gradients, and the effect of these gradients on formic acid permeability depends on the presence of other membrane transport proteins. We also examined the impact of CA activity on the flux of total CO2 through the brush border. Under physiological conditions, CA inhibition depressed NaHCO3 reabsorption through the brush border by interfering with the HCO3(-)-facilitated diffusion of CO2. However, the determination of brush-border CO2 permeability, using an imposed CO2 gradient, was relatively uninfluenced by CA activity. Finally, we inserted a kinetic representation of the Na+/H+ exchanger into the brush-border model. Even when luminal and cytosolic diffusion coefficients were increased 1,000-fold, there was no effect on brush-border Na+ flux. This suggests that variations in the unstirred layer cannot be responsible for the flow dependence of Na+ reabsorption.},

By doing so, they place in a new light the role of enhanced ASM mass in airway hyper-responsiveness as well as in the failure of a deep inspiration to relax the asthmatic airway. These findings have established that (i) ASM length is equilibrated dynamically, not statically; (ii) ASM dynamics closely resemble physical features exhibited by so-called soft glassy materials; (iii) static force-length relationships fail to describe dynamically contracted ASM states; (iv) stretch fluidizes the ASM cytoskeleton. Taken together, these observations suggest that at the origin of the bronchodilatory effect of a deep inspiration, and its failure in asthma, may lie glassy dynamics of the ASM cell.},

	Abstract = {Episodic hormone secretion is a characteristic feature of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal system, in which the profile of gonadotropin release from pituitary gonadotrophs reflects the pulsatile secretory activity of GnRH-producing neurons in the hypothalamus. Pulsatile release of GnRH is also evident in vitro during perifusion of immortalized GnRH neurons (GT1-7 cells) and cultured fetal hypothalamic cells, which continue to produce bioactive GnRH for up to 2 months. Such cultures, as well as hypothalamic tissue from adult rats, express GnRH receptors as evidenced by the presence of high-affinity GnRH binding sites and GnRH receptor transcripts. Furthermore, individual GnRH neurons coexpress GnRH and GnRH receptors as revealed by double immunostaining of hypothalamic cultures. In static cultures of hypothalamic neurons and GT1-7 cells, treatment with the GnRH receptor antagonist, [D-pGlu1, D-Phe2, D-Trp(3,6)]GnRH caused a prominent increase in GnRH release. In perifused hypothalamic cells and GT1-7 cells, treatment with the GnRH receptor agonist, des-Gly10-[D-Ala6]GnRH N-ethylamide, reduced the frequency and increased the amplitude of pulsatile GnRH release, as previously observed in GT1-7 cells. In contrast, exposure to the GnRH antagonist analogs abolished pulsatile secretion and caused a sustained and progressive increase in GnRH release. These findings have demonstrated that GnRH receptors are expressed in hypothalamic GnRH neurons, and that receptor activation is required for pulsatile GnRH release in vitro. The effects of GnRH agonist and antagonist analogs on neuropeptide release are consistent with the operation of an ultrashort-loop autocrine feedback mechanism that exerts both positive and negative actions that are necessary for the integrated control of GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus.},

Coupled equations describing the pressure losses in the flow and the pressure-area behavior of the airway were integrated along the airway from the periphery to the flow-limiting site. Equations describing pressure losses in the flow were adapted from studied of bronchial casts. The bronchial anatomy utilized was that described by Weibel. Bronchial mechanical properties were obtained from measurements in excised human lungs for the central airways and by extrapolations of these data for the peripheral airways. The maximal flow for air and helium predicted by the model agrees with that of five lungs from which mechanical properties were obtained. The model predictions agree with published values of density and viscosity dependence of maximal flow. At high and midlung volumes, maximal flow is determined primarily by the wave-speed mechanism. At low lung volumes, maximal flow is primarily determined by the coupling of viscous pressure losses and airway mechanical properties.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase types 1 and 2, and nimesulide, a cyclooxygenase 2 selective inhibitor, are both well-known inhibitors of prostaglandin production. It has been assumed that the tocolytic mechanism of nimesulide and indomethacin is only through decreased prostaglandin production. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that either nimesulide or indomethacin, or both, has a mechanism of action on human myocytes other than inhibition of prostaglandin production. STUDY DESIGN: Human uterine myometrium was obtained from consenting patients during cesarean deliveries. Myocytes were cultured, plated, and loaded with a calcium-dependent fluorescent dye, calcium green 1. The relative concentrations of intracellular free calcium were determined by measurement of time-dependent fluorescence changes by means of a video fluorimeter. In all experiments, cells were stimulated with prostaglandin F2alpha, 30 micromol/L. Experiments were performed without pretreatment (control) or with pretreatment consisting of indomethacin, 10 micromol/L, or nimesulide, 30 micromol/L. The percentages of cells demonstrating calcium increases were counted and compared by means of the Fisher exact test. A P value =.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: After prostaglandin F2alpha exposure, 33% of cells showed an increase in intracellular free calcium under control conditions. When pretreated with nimesulide, 39% of cells responded to prostaglandin F2alpha (P =.59). When pretreated with indomethacin, only 16% of cells responded to prostaglandin F2alpha (P =.019). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with nimesulide failed to reduce the fraction of cells that responded to prostaglandin F2alpha. In contrast, pretreatment with indomethacin significantly reduced the fraction of responding cells. These data suggest that, in vitro, indomethacin exhibits a mechanism of tocolysis other than inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.},

	Abstract = {The report of the crystal structure of the Ca(2+)-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum in its Ca(2+)-bound form [Toyoshima, Nakasako and Ogawa (2000) Nature (London) 405, 647-655] provides an opportunity to interpret much kinetic and mutagenic data on the ATPase in structural terms. There are no large channels leading from the cytoplasmic surface to the pair of high-affinity Ca(2+) binding sites within the transmembrane region. One possible access pathway involves the charged residues in transmembrane alpha-helix M1, with a Ca(2+) ion passing through the first site to reach the second site. The Ca(2+)-ATPase also contains a pair of binding sites for Ca(2+) that are exposed to the lumen. In the four-site model for transport, phosphorylation of the ATPase leads to transfer of the two bound Ca(2+) ions from the cytoplasmic to the lumenal pair of sites. In the alternating four-site model for transport, phosphorylation leads to release of the bound Ca(2+) ions directly from the cytoplasmic pair of sites, linked to closure of the pair of lumenal binding sites. The lumenal pair of sites could involve a cluster of conserved acidic residues in the loop between M1 and M2. Since there is no obvious pathway from the high-affinity sites to the lumenal surface of the membrane, transport of Ca(2+) ions must involve a significant change in the packing of the transmembrane alpha-helices. The link between the phosphorylation domain and the pair of high-affinity Ca(2+) binding sites is probably provided by two small helices, P1 and P2, in the phosphorylation domain, which contact the loop between transmembrane alpha-helices M6 and M7.},

	Abstract = {The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is the principal Ca2+-release channel in excitable cells, whereas the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) is primarily responsible for Ca2+ release in non-excitable cells, including epithelia. RyR also is expressed in a number of non-excitable cell types, but is thought to serve as an auxiliary or alternative Ca2+-release pathway in those cells. Here we use reverse transcription PCR to show that a polarized epithelium, the pancreatic acinar cell, expresses the type 2, but not the type 1 or 3, isoform of RyR. We furthermore use immunochemistry to demonstrate that the type 2 RyR is distributed throughout the basolateral and, to a lesser extent, the apical region of the acinar cell, but is excluded from the trigger zone, where cytosolic Ca2+ signals originate in this cell type. Since propagation of Ca2+ waves in acinar cells is sensitive to ryanodine, caffeine and Ca2+, these findings suggest that Ca2+ waves in this cell type result from the co-ordinated release of Ca2+, first from InsP3Rs in the trigger zone, then from RyRs elsewhere in the cell. RyR may play a fundamental role in Ca2+ signalling in polarized epithelia, including for Ca2+ signals initiated by InsP3.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of a postsynaptically expressed form of cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell long-term potentiation (LTP) raises the question whether this is the long-sought resetting mechanism for long-term depression (LTD). Extracellular monitoring of PC spikes enables stable prolonged recordings of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synaptic efficacy. LTD, saturated by repeated induction protocols, can be reversed by a single round of postsynaptic LTP or nitric oxide (NO), enabling LTD to be reinduced. Conversely, after postsynaptic LTP has been saturated, one round of LTD permits fresh postsynaptic LTP. By contrast, after saturation of LTD, induction of presynaptic LTP or application of forskolin leaves LTD still saturated. Likewise, presynaptic LTP cannot be reversed by LTD. Therefore postsynaptic LTP mediated by NO without postsynaptic Ca2+ elevation, unlike presynaptic LTP mediated by cAMP, is a true counterbalance to LTD mediated by coincidence of NO plus postsynaptic Ca2+},

	Abstract = {Calcium-sensitive dual excitation dyes, such as fura-2, are now widely used to measure the free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) in living cells. Preferentially, [Ca2+] is calculated in a ratiometric manner, but if calcium images need to be acquired at high temporal resolution, a potential drawback of ratiometry is that it requires equally fast switching of the excitation light between two wavelengths. To circumvent continuous excitation switching, some investigators have devised methods for calculating [Ca2+] from single-wavelength measurements combined with the acquisition of a single ratiometric pair of fluorescence images at the start of the recording. These methods, however, are based on the assumption that the concentration of the dye does not change during the experiment, a condition that is often not fulfilled. We describe here a method of single-wavelength calcium imaging, in which the dye concentration is estimated from ratiometric fluorescence image pairs acquired at regular intervals during the recording period, that furthermore includes a correction for the changing dye concentration in the calculation of [Ca2+].},

	Abstract = {This study examined [Ca2+]i oscillations in the human salivary gland cell lines, HSY and HSG. Relatively low concentrations of carbachol (CCh) induced oscillatory, and higher [CCh] induced sustained, steady-state increases in [Ca2+]i and KCa currents in both cell types. Low IP3, but not thapsigargin (Tg), induced [Ca2+]i oscillations, whereas Tg blocked CCh-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations in both cell types. Unlike in HSG cells, removal of extracellular Ca2+ from HSY cells (i) did not affect CCh-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations or internal Ca2+ store refill, and (ii) converted high [CCh]-induced steady-state increase in [Ca2+]i into oscillations. CCh- or thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx was higher in HSY, than in HSG, cells. Importantly, HSY cells displayed relatively higher levels of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (SERCA) and inositoltrisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) than HSG cells. These data demonstrate that [Ca2+]i oscillations in both HSY and HSG cells are primarily determined by the uptake of Ca2+ from, and release of Ca2+ into, the cytosol by the SERCA and IP3R activities, respectively. In HSY cells, Ca2+ influx does not acutely contribute to this process, although it determines the steady-state increase in [Ca2+]i. In HSG cells, [Ca2+]i oscillations directly depend on Ca2+ influx; Ca2+ coming into the cell is rapidly taken up into the store and then released into the cytosol. We suggest that the differences in the mechanism of [Ca2+]i oscillations HSY and HSG cells is related to their respective abilities to recycle internal Ca2+ stores.},

	Abstract = {We examined the regulation of calcium signalling in atrial cardiomyocytes during excitation-contraction coupling, and how changes in the distribution of calcium impacts on contractility. Under control conditions, calcium transients originated in subsarcolemmal locations and showed local regeneration through activation of calcium-induced calcium release from ryanodine receptors. Despite functional ryanodine receptors being expressed at regular (approximately 2 microm) intervals throughout atrial myocytes, the subsarcolemmal calcium signal did not spread in a fully regenerative manner through the interior of a cell. Rather, there was a diminishing centripetal propagation of calcium. The lack of regeneration was due to mitochondria and SERCA pumps preventing the inward movement of calcium. Inhibiting these calcium buffering mechanisms allowed the globalisation of action potential-evoked responses. In addition, physiological positive inotropic agents, such as endothelin-1 and beta-adrenergic agonists, as well as enhanced calcium current, calcium store loading and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate infusion also led to regenerative global responses. The consequence of globalising calcium signals was a significant increase in cellular contraction. These data indicate how calcium signals and their consequences are determined by the interplay of multiple subcellular calcium management systems.},

	Abstract = {Phenotypic modulation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) is an important feature of airway remodeling in asthma that is characterized by enhanced proliferation and secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines. These activities are regulated by the concentration of free Ca(2+) in the cytosol ([Ca(2+)](i)). A rise in [Ca(2+)](i) is normalized by rapid reuptake of Ca(2+) into sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) (SERCA) pump. We examined whether increased proliferative and secretory responses of ASM from asthmatics result from reduced SERCA expression. ASM cells were cultured from subjects with and without asthma. SERCA expression was evaluated by western blot, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Changes in [Ca(2+)](i), cell spreading, cellular proliferation, and eotaxin-1 release were measured. Compared with control cells from healthy subjects, SERCA2 mRNA and protein expression was reduced in ASM cells from subjects with moderately severe asthma. SERCA2 expression was similarly reduced in ASM in vivo in subjects with moderate/severe asthma. Rises in [Ca(2+)](i) following cell surface receptor-induced SR activation, or inhibition of SERCA-mediated Ca(2+) re-uptake, were attenuated in ASM cells from asthmatics. Likewise, the return to baseline of [Ca](i) after stimulation by bradykinin was delayed by approximately 50% in ASM cells from asthmatics. siRNA-mediated knockdown of SERCA2 in ASM from healthy subjects increased cell spreading, eotaxin-1 release and proliferation. Our findings implicate a deficiency in SERCA2 in ASM in asthma that contributes to its secretory and hyperproliferative phenotype in asthma, and which may play a key role in mechanisms of airway remodeling.},

A proposed reason for this diversity of InsP3R expression is that the isoforms are differentially inhibited by high cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), possibly due to their different interactions with calmodulin. Here, we have investigated the possible roles of calmodulin and bath [Ca2+] in mediating high [Ca2+]i inhibition of InsP3R gating by studying single endogenous type 1 InsP3R channels through patch clamp electrophysiology of the outer membrane of isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Neither high concentrations of a calmodulin antagonist nor overexpression of a dominant-negative Ca2+-insensitive mutant calmodulin affected inhibition of gating by high [Ca2+]i. However, a novel, calmodulin-independent regulation of [Ca2+]i inhibition of gating was revealed: whereas channels recorded from nuclei kept in the regular bathing solution with [Ca2+] approximately 400 nM were inhibited by 290 muM [Ca2+]i, exposure of the isolated nuclei to a bath solution with ultra-low [Ca2+] (&lt;5 nM, for approximately 300 s) before the patch-clamp experiments reversibly relieved Ca2+ inhibition, with channel activities observed in [Ca2+]i up to 1.5 mM. Although InsP3 activates gating by relieving high [Ca2+]i inhibition, it was nevertheless still required to activate channels that lacked high [Ca2+]i inhibition. Our observations suggest that high [Ca2+]i inhibition of InsP3R channel gating is not regulated by calmodulin, whereas it can be disrupted by environmental conditions experienced by the channel, raising the possibility that presence or absence of high [Ca2+]i inhibition may not be an immutable property of different InsP3R isoforms. Furthermore, these observations support an allosteric model in which Ca2+ inhibition of the InsP3R is mediated by two Ca2+ binding sites, only one of which is sensitive to InsP3.},

	Abstract = {A family of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) Ca2+ release channels plays a central role in Ca2+ signaling in most cells, but functional correlates of isoform diversity are unclear. Patch-clamp electrophysiology of endogenous type 1 (X-InsP3R-1) and recombinant rat type 3 InsP3R (r-InsP3R-3) channels in the outer membrane of isolated Xenopus oocyte nuclei indicated that enhanced affinity and reduced cooperativity of Ca2+ activation sites of the InsP3-liganded type 3 channel distinguished the two isoforms. Because Ca2+ activation of type 1 channel was the target of regulation by cytoplasmic ATP free acid concentration ([ATP](i)), here we studied the effects of [ATP]i on the dependence of r-InsP(3)R-3 gating on cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i. As [ATP]i was increased from 0 to 0.5 mM, maximum r-InsP3R-3 channel open probability (Po) remained unchanged, whereas the half-maximal activating [Ca2+]i and activation Hill coefficient both decreased continuously, from 800 to 77 nM and from 1.6 to 1, respectively, and the half-maximal inhibitory [Ca2+]i was reduced from 115 to 39 microM. These effects were largely due to effects of ATP on the mean closed channel duration. Whereas the r-InsP3R-3 had a substantially higher Po than X-InsP3R-1 in activating [Ca2+]i (&lt; 1 microM) and 0.5 mM ATP, the Ca2+ dependencies of channel gating of the two isoforms became remarkably similar in the absence of ATP. Our results suggest that ATP binding is responsible for conferring distinct gating properties on the two InsP3R channel isoforms. Possible molecular models to account for the distinct regulation by ATP of the Ca2+ activation properties of the two channel isoforms and the physiological implications of these results are discussed. Complex regulation by ATP of the types 1 and 3 InsP3R channel activities may enable cells to generate sophisticated patterns of Ca2+ signals with cytoplasmic ATP as one of the second messengers.},

	Abstract = {Background: Ca^2^+ waves allow effective delivery of intracellular Ca^2^+ signals to cytosolic targets. Propagation of these regenerative Ca^2^+ signals probably results from the activation of intracellular Ca^2^+ channels by the increase in cytosolic [Ca^2^+] that follows the opening of these channels. Such positive feedback is potentially explosive. Mechanisms that limit the spontaneous opening of intracellular Ca^2^+ channels are therefore likely to have evolved in parallel with the mechanism of Ca^2^+-induced Ca^2^+ release.Results: Maximal rates of ^4^5Ca^2^+ efflux from permeabilised hepatocytes superfused with medium in which the [Ca^2^+] was clamped were cooperatively stimulated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP&quot;3). A minimal interval of ~400 msec between IP&quot;3 addition and the peak rate of Ca^2^+ mobilisation indicate that channel opening does not immediately follow binding of IP&quot;3. Although the absolute latency of Ca^2^+ release was unaffected by further increasing the IP&quot;3 concentration, it was reduced by increased [Ca^2^+].Conclusions: We propose that the closed conformation of the IP&quot;3 receptor is very stable and therefore minimally susceptible to spontaneous activation; at least three (probably four) IP&quot;3 molecules may be required to provide enough binding energy to drive the receptor into a stable open conformation. We suggest that a further defence from noise is provided by an extreme form of coincidence detection. Binding of IP&quot;3 to each of its four receptor subunits unmasks a site to which Ca^2^+ must bind before the channel can open. As IP&quot;3 binding may also initiate receptor inactivation, there may be only a narrow temporal window during which each receptor subunit must bind both of its agonists if the channel is to open rather than inactivate.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Available insulin sensitivity (IS) methods based on the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are empirical. We used a glucose-insulin model to derive an OGTT-based IS (oral glucose insulin sensitivity [OGIS]) index, which predicts glucose clearance in a glucose clamp. We validated OGIS against clamp data.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: OGIS requires glucose and insulin concentrations from a 75-g OGTT at 0, 2, and 3 h (3-h OGTT) or at 0, 1.5, and 2 h (2-h OGTT). The formula includes six constants optimized to match the clamp results. For this purpose, 15 lean nondiabetic subjects (BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2), 38 obese nondiabetic subjects (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2), and 38 subjects with type 2 diabetes randomly underwent an OGTT and a 120 mU x min(-1) x m(-2) insulin infusion euglycemic clamp. Glucose clearance (Cl CLAMP), calculated as the ratio of glucose infusion to concentration during the last hour of the clamp, was compared with OGIS. OGIS was also tested on an independent group of 13 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).RESULTS: OGIS and Cl CLAMP were correlated in the whole group (R = 0.77, P &lt; 0.0001), in the subgroups (lean: R = 0.59; obese: R = 0.73; type 2 diabetes: R = 0.49; P &lt; 0.02), and in the independent IGT group (R = 0.65, P &lt; 0.02). Reproducibility of OGIS and Cl CLAMP were similar (coefficients of variation: OGIS 7.1%, Cl CLAMP 6.4%). OGIS was as effective as Cl CLAMP in discriminating between groups (for OGIS, lean vs. obese: 440 +/- 16 vs. 362 +/- 11 ml x min(-1) x m(-2), p &lt; 0.001; lean vs. type 2 diabetes: 440 +/- 16 vs. 239 +/- 7, P &lt; 0.0001; obese vs. type 2 diabetes: 362 +/- 11 vs. 239 +/- 7, P &lt; 0.0001; results were similar for Cl CLAMP). The relationships between IS and BMI, fasting plasma insulin, and insulin secretion (calculated from the OGTT insulin concentration) were examined. OGIS yielded results similar to Cl CLAMP and fully consistent with established physiological principles. The performance of the index for the 3-h and 2-h OGTT was similar.CONCLUSIONS: OGIS is an index of IS in good agreement with the clamp. Because of its simplicity (only three blood samples required), this method has potential use for clinical investigation including large-scale epidemiological studies.},

	Abstract = {Osmotically driven water flow, u (cm/s), between two solutions of identical osmolarity, c(o) (300 mM: in mammals), has a theoretical isotonic maximum given by u = j/c(o), where j (moles/cm(2)/s) is the rate of salt transport. In many experimental studies, transport was found to be indistinguishable from isotonic. The purpose of this work is to investigate the conditions for u to approach isotonic. A necessary condition is that the membrane salt/water permeability ratio, epsilon, must be small: typical physiological values are epsilon = 10(-3) to 10(-5), so epsilon is generally small but this is not sufficient to guarantee near-isotonic transport. If we consider the simplest model of two series membranes, which secrete a tear or drop of sweat (i.e., there are no externally-imposed boundary conditions on the secretion), diffusion is negligible and the predicted osmolarities are: basal = c(o), intracellular approximately (1 + epsilon)c(o), secretion approximately (1 + 2epsilon)c(o), and u approximately (1 - 2epsilon)j/c(o). Note that this model is also appropriate when the transported solution is experimentally collected. Thus, in the absence of external boundary conditions, transport is experimentally indistinguishable from isotonic. However, if external boundary conditions set salt concentrations to c(o) on both sides of the epithelium, then fluid transport depends on distributed osmotic gradients in lateral spaces. If lateral spaces are too short and wide, diffusion dominates convection, reduces osmotic gradients and fluid flow is significantly less than isotonic. Moreover, because apical and basolateral membrane water fluxes are linked by the intracellular osmolarity, water flow is maximum when the total water permeability of basolateral membranes equals that of apical membranes. In the context of the renal proximal tubule, data suggest it is transporting at near optimal conditions. Nevertheless, typical physiological values suggest the newly filtered fluid is reabsorbed at a rate u approximately 0.86 j/c(o), so a hypertonic solution is being reabsorbed. The osmolarity of the filtrate c(F) (M) will therefore diminish with distance from the site of filtration (the glomerulus) until the solution being transported is isotonic with the filtrate, u = j/c(F).With this steady-state condition, the distributed model becomes approximately equivalent to two membranes in series. The osmolarities are now: c(F) approximately (1 - 2epsilon)j/c(o), intracellular approximately (1 - epsilon)c(o), lateral spaces approximately c(o), and u approximately (1 + 2epsilon)j/c(o). The change in c(F) is predicted to occur with a length constant of about 0.3 cm. Thus, membrane transport tends to adjust transmembrane osmotic gradients toward epsilonc(o), which induces water flow that is isotonic to within order epsilon. These findings provide a plausible hypothesis on how the proximal tubule or other epithelia appear to transport an isotonic solution.},

Computer simulations are useful in examining this cerebellar computation, as they inherently address function at the level of information processing. Progress is facilitated by factors that make the cerebellum particularly amenable to such analysis. We review progress from two contrasting approaches. Top-down simulations begin with hypotheses about computational mechanisms and then ask how such mechanisms might operate within the cerebellum. Bottom-up simulations attempt to build a representation of the cerebellum that reflects known cellular and synaptic components as accurately as possible. We describe recent advances from these two approaches that are leading to an understanding of what information the cerebellum processes and how its neurons and synapses accomplish this task.},

	Abstract = {Phasic transmitter release at synapses in the mammalian CNS is regulated by local [Ca2+] transients, which control the fusion of readily releasable vesicles docked at active zones (AZs) in the presynaptic membrane. The time course and amplitude of these [Ca2+] transients critically determine the time course and amplitude of the release and thus the frequency and amplitude tuning of the synaptic connection. As yet, the spatiotemporal nature of the [Ca2+] transients and the number and location of release-controlling Ca2+ channels relative to the vesicles, the &quot;topography&quot; of the release sites, have remained elusive. We used a time-dependent model to simulate Ca2+ influx, three-dimensional buffered Ca2+ diffusion, and the binding of Ca2+ to the release sensor. The parameters of the model were constrained by recent anatomical and biophysical data of the calyx of Held. Comparing the predictions of the model with previously measured release probabilities under a variety of experimental conditions, we inferred which release site topography is likely to operate at the calyx: At each AZ one or a few clusters of Ca2+ channels control the release of the vesicles. The distance of a vesicle to the cluster(s) varies across the multiple release sites of a single calyx (ranging from 30 to 300 nm; average approximately 100 nm). Assuming this topography, vesicles in different locations are exposed to different [Ca2+] transients, with peak amplitudes ranging from 0.5 to 40 microm (half-width approximately 400 microsec) during an action potential. Consequently the vesicles have different release probabilities ranging from &lt;0.01 to 1. We demonstrate how this spatially heterogeneous release probability creates functional advantages for synaptic transmission.},

Due to the Ca(2+) requirement, the IP(3)R and the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration form a positive feedback loop, which has been assumed to confer regenerativity on the IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release and to play an important role in the generation of spatiotemporal patterns of Ca(2+) signals such as Ca(2+) waves and oscillations. Here we show that glutamate 2100 of rat type 1 IP(3)R (IP(3)R1) is a key residue for the Ca(2+) requirement. Substitution of this residue by aspartate (E2100D) results in a 10-fold decrease in the Ca(2+) sensitivity without other effects on the properties of the IP(3)R1. Agonist-induced Ca(2+) responses are greatly diminished in cells expressing the E2100D mutant IP(3)R1, particularly the rate of rise of initial Ca(2+) spike is markedly reduced and the subsequent Ca(2+) oscillations are abolished. These results demonstrate that the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the IP(3)R is functionally indispensable for the determination of Ca(2+) signaling patterns.},

	Abstract = {Analyzing signal and noise for any sensory system requires an appreciation of the biological and physical milieu of the animal. Behavioral studies show that elasmobranchs use their electrosensory systems extensively for prey detection, but also for mate recognition and possibly for navigation. These biologically important signals are detected against a background of self-generated bioelectric fields. Noise-suppression mechanisms can be recognized at a number of different levels: behavior, receptor anatomy and physiology, and at the early stages of sensory processing. The peripheral filters and receptor characteristics provide a detector with permissive temporal properties but restrictive spatial characteristics. Biologically important signals probably cover the range from direct current to 10 Hz, whereas the bandwidth of the receptors is more like 0.1-10 Hz. This degree of alternating current coupling overcomes significant noise problems while still allowing the animal to detect external direct current signals by its own movement. Self-generated bioelectric fields modulated by breathing movement have similar temporal characteristics to important external signals and produce very strong modulation of electrosensory afferents. This sensory reafference is essentially similar, or common-mode, across all afferent fibers. The principal electrosensory neurons (ascending efferent neurons; AENs) of the dorsal octavolateralis nucleus show a greatly reduced response to common-mode signals. This suppression is mediated by the balanced excitatory and inhibitory components of their spatial receptive fields. The receptive field characteristics of AENs determine the information extracted from external stimuli for further central processing.},

If the perturbing flow signal is broadband and not too large in amplitude, linear behavior is usually assumed and the input impedance calculated. Alternatively, some researchers have used flow signals that are narrow band but large in amplitude, and invoked nonlinear lumped-parameter models to account for the relationship between flow and pressure. There has been little attempt, however, to deal with respiratory data that are both broadband and reflective of system nonlinearities. In the present study, we collected such data from mice. To interpret these data, we first developed a time-domain approximation to a widely used model of respiratory input impedance. We then extended this model to include nonlinear resistive and elastic terms. We found that the nonlinear elastic term fit the data better than the linear model or the nonlinear resistance model when amplitudes were large.

	Abstract = {Fura-2 and BAPTA were previously shown to be competitive antagonists of inositol trisphosphate (InsP&quot;3) receptors, but for practical reasons the analyses were performed at pH 8.3. We recently developed a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) for pure cerebellar InsP&quot;3receptors which allows low affinity interactions to be characterized and is readily applicable to scarce or expensive ligands. In the present study, we use SPA to demonstrate that at pH 7.2, many of the commonly used fluorescent Ca^2^+indicators reversibly displace^3H-InsP&quot;3from its receptor and that they differ substantially in their affinities for the InsP&quot;3receptor (IC&quot;5&quot;0= 6.5-137 @mM). Recombinant type 1 InsP&quot;3receptors expressed in Sf9 cells were used to examine^3H-InsP&quot;3binding in cytosol-like medium: both fura-2 (IC&quot;5&quot;0= 796+/-86 @mM) and Ca Green-5N (IC&quot;5&quot;0= 62+/-7 @mM) completely inhibited the binding, but only in their Ca^2^+-free forms. Similar results were obtained with type 3 InsP&quot;3receptors. We conclude that many Ca^2^+indicators in their Ca^2^+-free forms compete with InsP&quot;3for binding to its receptor, and that for Ca Green-5N the interaction occurs with sufficient affinity to significantly perturb physiological responses.},

A fusion construct of PH(PLCdelta) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-PH(PLCdelta)) associates with the plasma membrane due to its association with PtdIns(4,5)P(2). However, PH(PLCdelta) has greater affinity for Ins(1,4,5)P(3) than PtdIns(4,5)P(2), and translocates to the cytosol as Ins(1,4,5)P(3) levels rise. Prolonged activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 1alpha expressed in Chinese-hamster ovary cells or endogenous M(3) muscarinic receptors in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells gave an initial transient peak in translocation, followed by a sustained plateau phase. This closely followed changes in cell population Ins(1,4,5)P(3) mass, but not PtdIns(4,5)P(2) levels, which decreased monophasically, as determined by radioreceptor assay. Translocation thus provides a real-time method to follow increases in Ins(1,4,5)P(3). Graded changes in Ins(1,4,5)P(3) in Chinese-hamster ovary-lac-mGlu1alpha cells could be detected with increasing glutamate concentrations, and dual loading with fura 2 and EGFP-PH(PLCdelta) showed that changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration closely paralleled Ins(1,4,5)P(3) production. Moreover, Ins(1,4,5)P(3) accumulation and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization within single cells is graded in nature and dependent on both agonist concentration and receptor density.},

	Abstract = {In the present study, the contribution of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P(3)] generation on the mechanical-stimulation-induced Ca(2+) response was investigated in HSY-EA1 cells. Mechanical stimulation induced a local increase in the cytosolic concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) ([IP(3)](i)), as indicated by the Ins(1,4,5)P(3) biosensor LIBRAvIII. The area of this increase expanded like an intracellular Ins(1,4,5)P(3) wave as [IP(3)](i) increased in the stimulated region. A small transient [IP(3)](i) increase was subsequently seen in neighboring cells. The phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 abolished these Ins(1,4,5)P(3) responses and resultant Ca(2+) releases. The purinergic receptor blocker suramin completely blocked increases in [IP(3)](1) and the Ca(2+) release in neighboring cells, but failed to attenuate the responses in mechanically stimulated cells. These results indicate that generation of Ins(1,4,5)P(3) in response to mechanical stimulation is primarily independent of extracellular ATP. The speed of the mechanical-stimulation-induced [IP(3)](i) increase was much more rapid than that induced by a supramaximal concentration of ATP (1 mM). The contribution of the Ins(1,4,5)P(3)-induced Ca(2+) release was larger than that of Ca(2+) entry in the Ca(2+) response to mechanical stimulation in HSY-EA1 cells.},

Parameters of the osmotically significant transport processes were varied to assess the sensitivity of water transport and fluid composition to transport perturbations. Establishment and regulation of water secretion represent a coordinated function of at least seven different ion transport processes: basolateral passive potassium transport, basolateral active sodium-potassium transport, basolateral sodium-potassium-chloride cotransport, apical passive sodium and chloride transport, and diffusion of sodium and chloride across the paracellular path. We found that apical chloride permeability at a level reported for cystic fibrosis is sufficient to cause the airway dehydration characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Given the reduction in apical chloride permeability in cystic fibrosis, a reduction in apical sodium permeability can potentially compensate completely for the airway dehydration associated with the cystic fibrosis genetic defect. Other simulations presented here address the importance of various membrane transport processes in airway epithelium water balance and the sensitivity of epithelium water balance to ion transport perturbations.},

	Abstract = {In many nonexcitable cells, depletion of the inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate-sensitive store activates Ca2+ influx, a process termed store-operated Ca2+ entry. In rat basophilic leukemia cells, emptying of the stores activates a highly selective Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (CRAC), ICRAC. We have recently found that ICRAC activates in an essentially all-or-none manner when the current is evoked by receptor stimulation, dialysis with inositol 1, 4,5-trisphosphate via the patch pipette, or through the Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (Parekh, A. B., Fleig, A., and Penner, R. (1997) Cell 89, 973-980). Regulatory mechanisms must therefore operate to control the overall amount of Ca2+ that enters through CRAC channels. Such mechanisms include membrane potential and protein kinase C. In the present study, we have investigated additional inhibitory pathways that serve to determine just how much Ca2+ can enter through ICRAC. We have directly measured the current using the whole cell patch clamp technique. We report the presence of a slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation mechanism that curtails Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels. This inactivation mechanism is switched on by Ca2+ entering through CRAC channels, and therefore constitutes a slow negative feedback process. Although it requires a rise in intracellular Ca2+ for activation, it maintains CRAC channels inactive even under conditions that lower intracellular Ca2+ levels. The inactivation mechanism does not involve store refilling, protein phosphorylation, G proteins, nor Ca2+-dependent enzymes. It accounts for up to 70% of the total inactivation of ICRAC, and therefore appears to be a dominant inhibitory mechanism. It is likely to be an important factor that shapes the profile of the Ca2+ signal in these nonexcitable cells.},

The type 2 (InsP(3)R2) and type 3 (InsP(3)R3) InsP(3)R are the predominant isoforms expressed in acinar cells and are required for proper exocrine gland function. Both InsP(3)R2 and InsP(3)R3 are positively regulated by cytosolic ATP, but InsP(3)R2 is 10-fold more sensitive than InsP(3)R3 to this form of modulation. In this study, we examined the role of InsP(3)R2 in setting the sensitivity of InsP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release (IICR) to ATP in pancreatic acinar cells. IICR was measured in permeabilized acinar cells from wild-type (WT) and InsP(3)R2 knock-out (KO) mice. ATP augmented IICR from WT pancreatic cells with an EC(50) of 38 microm. However, the EC(50) was 10-fold higher in acinar cells isolated from InsP(3)R2-KO mice, indicating a role for InsP(3)R2 in setting the sensitivity of IICR to ATP. Consistent with this idea, heterologous expression of InsP(3)R2 in RinM5F cells, which natively express predominately InsP(3)R3, increased the sensitivity of IICR to ATP. Depletion of ATP attenuated agonist-induced Ca(2+) signaling in WT pancreatic acinar cells. This effect was more profound in acinar cells prepared from InsP(3)R2-KO mice. These data suggest that the sensitivity of IICR to ATP depletion is regulated by the particular complement of InsP(3)R expressed in an individual cell. The effects of metabolic stress on intracellular Ca(2+) signals can therefore be determined by the relative amount of InsP(3)R2 expressed in cells.},

We observed rapid movements and equilibration of Ca(2+) and the probes. The bulk of the ER at the base was not connected to the granules in the apical part, but diffusion into small apical ER extensions occurred. The connectivity of the ER Ca(2+) store was robust, since even supramaximal acetylcholine (ACh) stimulation for 30 min did not result in functional fragmentation. ACh could elicit a uniform decrease in the ER Ca(2+) concentration throughout the cell, but repetitive cytosolic Ca(2+) spikes, induced by a low ACh concentration, hardly reduced the ER Ca(2+) level. We conclude that the ER is a functionally continuous unit, which enables efficient Ca(2+) liberation. Ca(2+) released from the apical ER terminals is quickly replenished from the bulk of the rough ER at the base.},

Ca^2^+ is needed at several steps of the cell cycle such as early G&quot;1, at the G&quot;1/S, and G&quot;2/M transitions. The Ca^2^+ signals in the form of time-dependent changes in intracellular Ca^2^+ concentrations, [Ca^2^+]&quot;i, are presented as brief spikes organized into regenerative Ca^2^+ waves. Ca^2^+-mediated signaling pathways have also been shown to play important roles in carcinogenesis such as transformation of normal cells to cancerous cells, tumor formation and growth, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Since the global Ca^2^+ oscillations arise from Ca^2^+ waves initiated locally, it results in stochastic oscillations because although each cell has many IP&quot;3Rs and Ca^2^+ ions, the law of large numbers does not apply to the initiating event which is restricted to very few IP&quot;3Rs due to steep Ca^2^+ concentration gradients. The specific Ca^2^+ signaling information is likely to be encoded in a calcium code as the amplitude, duration, frequency, waveform or timing of Ca^2^+ oscillations and decoded again at a later stage. Since Ca^2^+ channels or pumps involved in regulating Ca^2^+ signaling pathways show altered expression in cancer, one can target these Ca^2^+ channels and pumps as therapeutic options to decrease proliferation of cancer cells and to promote their apoptosis. These studies can provide novel insights into alterations in Ca^2^+ wave patterns in carcinogenesis and lead to the development of newer technologies based on Ca^2^+ waves for the diagnosis and therapy of cancer.},

The intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, [Ca(2+)](i), in resting cells is normally maintained at around 100 nM with a very steep ∼20,000 times concentration gradient of Ca(2+) between extracellular and intracellular compartments. Ca(2+) signals in the form of time-dependent changes in [Ca(2+)](i) appear as brief spikes that are organized into regenerative Ca(2+) waves. The release of Ca(2+) from internal stores plays a key role in regulating such Ca(2+) signals. Since global Ca(2+) oscillations arise from Ca(2+) waves initiated locally, it results in generation of stochastic Ca(2+) oscillations. In addition, the hierarchical organization of signaling structures translate the molecular fluctuations of single channels to the whole cell leading to formation of stochastic media. Several recent observations indicate that [Ca(2+)](i) changes are fluctuation driven as opposed to a typical deterministic intracellular reaction-diffusion system model. Elucidation of this signaling mechanism can provide detailed knowledge of relationship between cell signaling and cell physiology of living systems.},

As applied to the functioning and spatial organization of IP3Rs, this approach complements our existing knowledge, which derives largely from reduced systems - such as reconstitution into lipid bilayers and patch clamping of IP3Rs on the membrane of excised nuclei - where the spatial arrangement and interactions among IP3Rs via CICR are disrupted. The ability to image the activity of single IP3R channels with millisecond resolution together with localization of their positions with a precision of a few tens of nanometers both raises several intriguing questions and holds promise of answers. In particular, what mechanism underlies the anchoring of puffs and blips to static locations; why do these Ca2+ release events appear to involve only a very small fraction of the IP3Rs within a cell; and how can we reconcile the relative immotility of functional IP3Rs with numerous studies reporting free diffusion of IP3R protein in the ER membrane?},

By rapidly freezing scintillation proximity assay reactions and then counting the frozen samples, both fast and slow components of [3H] InsP3 association and dissociation were identified.

	Abstract = {The interactions between calmodulin, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), and pure cerebellar InsP3 receptors were characterized by using a scintillation proximity assay. In the absence of Ca2+, 125I-labeled calmodulin reversibly bound to multiple sites on InsP3 receptors and Ca2+ increased the binding by 190% +/- 10%; the half-maximal effect occurred when the Ca2+ concentration was 184 +/- 14 nM. In the absence of Ca2+, calmodulin caused a reversible, concentration-dependent (IC50 = 3.1 +/- 0.2 microM) inhibition of [3H]InsP3 binding by decreasing the affinity of the receptor for InsP3. This effect was similar at all Ca2+ concentrations, indicating that the site through which calmodulin inhibits InsP3 binding has similar affinities for calmodulin and Ca2+-calmodulin. Calmodulin (10 microM) inhibited the Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes evoked by submaximal, but not by maximal, concentrations of InsP3. Tonic inhibition of InsP3 receptors by the high concentrations of calmodulin within cerebellar Purkinje cells may account for their relative insensitivity to InsP3 and limit spontaneous activation of InsP3 receptors in the dendritic spines. Inhibition of InsP3 receptors by calmodulin at all cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, together with the known redistribution of neuronal calmodulin evoked by protein kinases and Ca2+, suggests that calmodulin may also allow both feedback control of InsP3 receptors and integration of inputs from other signaling pathways.},

The characteristic action of these agonists appears to arise from activation of a single receptor with active and desensitized states, for which AMPA and kainate have different relative affinity. The equilibrium potency of a series of five agonists that produce rapidly desensitizing responses at non-NMDA receptors (EC50 1 microM to 4 mM) was similar to their equilibrium potency for block of kainate responses. Increasing the concentration of kainate overcame such block, but in the presence of AMPA the rate of activation of responses to kainate was slowed. Conversely, in the presence of kainate the amplitude of rapidly desensitizing responses evoked by AMPA was reduced, and the rate of onset of desensitization was slowed.},

There is indirect evidence suggesting that receptor-activation in addition to generating the Ca2+ releasing messenger, inositol trisphosphate, also produces another regulator involved in the control of Ca2+ signal spreading. Intracellular inositol trisphosphate or Ca2+ infusion produce short duration repetitive spikes confined to the cytoplasmic area close to the plasma membrane, but these signals can be made to progress throughout the cell by addition of caffeine or by receptor activation.},

	Abstract = {We have studied by means of equilibrium binding and kinetic experiments the interaction of the membrane-bound nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACHR) from Torpedo marmorata with [3H]acetylcholine and the fluorescent agonist NBD-5-acylcholine. In agreement with previous studies by others, we observed the preexistence, in the absence of ligand, of an equilibrium between two states of the nAChR, one with high affinity and the other with low affinity for agonist. As additional requirements for a minimal reaction scheme, we recognized (i) the existence of two ligand-binding sites, each of which may exist in two conformational states when occupied, and (ii) ligand-induced transitions between these conformations. Employing a special form of the allosteric model which considers these requirements, we then developed a suitable algorithm in order to simultaneously fit the whole set of equilibrium binding and kinetic data obtained for the two ligands. In this way we determined for a minimal model of the mechanism of action of the nAChR the complete set of rate constants and KD values involved. With these values available, we were able to simulate the rise and fall in the concentrations of individual receptor-ligand complexes and conformations occurring in the course of excitatory events at the electrocyte synapse. The membrane environment of the nAChR plays a decisive role with respect to the rates of conformational change of the nAChR occurring in the course of ligand interaction. Thus, artificial changes in membrane structure and composition can speed up by several orders of magnitude the rate of conformational change (&quot;desensitization&quot;). A proper structure of the surrounding membrane hence is a prerequisite for the physiological function of the membrane-embedded nAChR.},

@article{proske1999,
	Abstract = {The tension rise during stretch of passive skeletal muscle is biphasic, with an initial steep rise, followed by a subsequent more gradual change. The initial rise has been interpreted as being due to the presence of numbers of long-term, stable cross-bridges in resting muscle fibres. A point of weakness with the cross-bridge interpretation is that the initial stiffness reaches its peak value at muscle lengths beyond the optimum for myofilament overlap. To explain this result it has been suggested that despite the reduced overlap at longer lengths, the closer interfilament spacing and a higher sensitivity of the myofilaments to Ca2+ allows more stable cross-bridges to form. Recently the stretch responses of passive muscle have been re-examined and it has been suggested that it is not necessary to invoke cross-bridge mechanisms at all. Explanations based on a viscous resistance to interfilament sliding and mechanical properties of the elastic filaments, the gap filaments, were thought to adequately account for the observed tension changes. However, an important property of passive muscle, the dependence of stretch responses on the immediate history of contraction and length changes, thixotropy, cannot be explained simply in terms of viscous and viscoelastic properties. The review discusses the cross-bridge interpretation of muscle thixotropy and the relationship of passive stiffness to filament resting tension and latency relaxation. It is proposed that cross-bridges can exist in three states; one, responsible for the resting stiffness, requires resting levels of calcium. When, during activation, calcium levels rise, cross-bridges enter a low-force, high-stiffness state, signalled by latency relaxation, before they move to the third, force-generating state. It is concluded that, compared with viscoelastic models, a cross-bridge-based explanation of passive muscle properties is better able to accommodate the currently known facts although, as new information becomes available, this view may need to be revised.},

The receptor protein was solubilized and incorporated into proteoliposomes for functional characterization. Single-channel recordings from proteoliposomes fused into planar lipid bilayers revealed that the recombinant protein formed InsP&quot;3- and Ca^2^+-sensitive ion channels. The unitary conductance (~250 pS; 220/20mM Cs^+ as charge carrier), gating, InsP&quot;3, and Ca^2^+ sensitivities were similar to those previously described for the native type 2 InsP&quot;3R channel. However, the maximum open probability of the recombinant channel was slightly lower than that of its native counterpart. These data show that our full-length rat type 2 InsP&quot;3R cDNA construct encodes a protein that forms an ion channel with functional attributes like those of the native type 2 InsP&quot;3R channel.

	Abstract = {The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP&quot;3R) family of Ca^2^+ release channels is central to intracellular Ca^2^+ signaling in mammalian cells. The InsP&quot;3R channels release Ca^2^+ from intracellular compartments to generate localized Ca^2^+ transients that govern a myriad of cellular signaling phenomena (Berridge, 1993. Nature. 361:315-325; Joseph, 1996. Cell Signal. 8:1-7; Kume et al., 1997. Science. 278:1940-1943; Berridge, 1997. Nature. 368:759-760). Most cells express multiple InsP&quot;3R isoforms, but only the function of the single type 1 InsP&quot;3R channel is known. Here the single-channel function of single type 2 InsP&quot;3R channel is defined for the first time. The type 2 InsP&quot;3R forms channels with permeation properties similar to that of the type 1 receptor. The InsP&quot;3 regulation and Ca^2^+ regulation of type 1 and type 2 InsP&quot;3R channels are strikingly different. Both InsP&quot;3 and Ca^2^+ are more effective at activating single type 2 InsP&quot;3R, indicating that single type 2 channels mobilize substantially more Ca^2^+ than single type 1 channels in cells. Furthermore, high cytoplasmic Ca^2^+ concentrations inactivate type 1, but not type 2, InsP&quot;3R channels. This indicates that type 2 InsP&quot;3R channel is different from the type 1 channel in that its activity will not be inherently self-limiting, because Ca^2^+ passing through an active type 2 channel cannot feed back and turn the channel off. Thus the InsP&quot;3R identity will help define the spatial and temporal nature of local Ca^2^+ signaling events and may contribute to the segregation of parallel InsP&quot;3 signaling cascades in mammalian cells.},

	Abstract = {Periodic release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) from the hypothalamus is essential for normal reproductive function. Pulsatile LHRH release appears to result from the synchronous activity of LHRH neurons. However, how the activity of these neurons is synchronized to release LHRH peptide in a pulsatile manner is unclear. Because there is little evidence of physical coupling among LHRH neurons in the hypothalamus, we hypothesized that the activity of LHRH neurons might be coordinated by indirect intercellular communication via intermediary (nonneural) cells rather than direct interneural coupling. In this study, we used an in vitro preparation of LHRH neurons derived from the olfactory placode of monkey embryos to assess whether nonneuronal cells, play a role in coordinating LHRH neuronal activity. We found that cultured LHRH neurons and nonneuronal cells both exhibit spontaneous oscillations in the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) at similar frequencies. Moreover, [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in both types of cell were periodically synchronized. Synchronized [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations spread as intercellular Ca(2+) waves across fields of cells that included LHRH neurons and nonneuronal cells, although waves spread at a higher velocity among LHRH neurons. These results suggest that LHRH neurons and nonneuronal cells are functionally integrated and that nonneuronal cells could be involved in synchronizing the activity of the LHRH neurosecretory network.},

	Abstract = {The uterus, usually quiescent during pregnancy, exhibits forceful contractions at term leading to delivery. These contractions are caused by the synchronized propagation of electrical waves from the pacemaker cells to its neighbors inducing the whole coordinated contraction of the uterus wall leading to labor. In a previous work, we simulate the electrical activity of a single uterine cell by a set of ordinary differential equations. Then, this model has been used to simulate the electrical activity propagation. In the present work, the uterine cell tissue is assumed to have uniform and isotropic propagation, and constant electrical membrane properties. The stability of the numerical solution imposes the choice of a critical temporal step. A wave starts at a pacemaker cell; this electrical activity is initiated by the injection of an external stimulation current to the cell membrane. We observe synchronous wave propagation for axial resistance values around 0.5 GOmega or less and propoagation blocking for values greater than 0.7 GOmega. We compute the conduction velocity of the excitation, for different axial resistance values, and obtain a velocity about 10 cm/sec, approaching the one described by the literature for the rat at end of term.},

The uterine excitability changes remarkably with time, generally quiescent during pregnancy, the uterus exhibits forceful synchronized contractions at term leading to fetus expulsion. These changes characterize thus a dynamical system susceptible of being studied through formal mathematical tools. Multiple physiological factors are involved in the regulation process of this complex system. Our aim is to relate the physiological factors to the uterine cell dynamic behaviors. Taking into account a previous work presented, in which the electrical activity of a uterine cell is described by a set of ordinary differential equations, we analyze the impact of physiological parameters on the response of the model, and identify the main subsystems generating the complex uterine electrical activity, with respect to physiological data.},

Serous glands consist of indented acini attached to the ducts in a grape-like fashion, whereas mucous and mixed glands are made up of smooth tubuli. Myoepithelial cells (mecs), which are abundant on the surfaces of acini, tubuli, and intercalated ducts, are sparse on striated ducts. They are star-shaped on acini, striated ducts, and most of the tubuli. Spindle-shaped mecs are seen, instead, on intercalated ducts and, occasionally, on mucous and mixed tubuli as well. Cells of striated ducts split into a number of large basal portions whose surface is covered by long laminated processes responsible for the striations seen with TEM. Excretory ducts are lined by small cup-shaped basal cells and by tall cylindrical cells, which are completely covered by short processes oriented at random. When observed from below, after removal of the basal lamina, the basal surfaces of cells of excretory ducts exhibit polygonal areas delimited by short reliefs. Those of striated ducts show, instead, long laminar processes arranged radially. Results presented here are discussed and put in relationship to the mechanism of saliva production.},

By contrast, learning and memory in vertebrate organisms is generally thought to be mediated, at least in part, by postsynaptic mechanisms. But new experimental evidence from research using a model invertebrate organism, the marine snail Aplysia, indicates that this apparent distinction between invertebrate and vertebrate synaptic mechanisms of learning is invalid: learning in Aplysia cannot be explained in terms of exclusively presynaptic mechanisms. NMDA-receptor-dependent LTP appears to be necessary for classical conditioning in Aplysia. Furthermore, modulation of trafficking of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors underlies behavioral sensitization in this snail. Exclusively presynaptic processes appear to support only relatively brief memory in Aplysia. More persistent memory is likely to be mediated by postsynaptic processes, or by presynaptic processes whose expression depends upon retrograde signals.},

	Abstract = {Temporally asymetric learning rules governing plastic changes in synaptic efficacy have recently been identified in physiological studies. In these rules, the exact timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes is critical to the induced change of synaptic efficacy. The temporal learning rules treated in this article are approximately antisymmetric; the synaptic efficacy is enhanced if the postsynaptic spike follows the presynaptic spike by a few milliseconds, but the efficacy is depressed if the postsynaptic spike precedes the presynaptic spike. The learning dynamics of this rule are studied using a stochastic model neuron receiving a set of serially delayed inputs. The average change of synaptic efficacy due to the temporally antisymmetric learning rule is shown to yield differential Hebbian learning. These results are demonstrated with both mathematical analyses and computer simulations, and connections with theories of classical conditioning are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of mormyrid electric fish is a cerebellum-like structure that receives primary afferent input from electroreceptors in the skin. Purkinje-like cells in ELL store and retrieve a temporally precise negative image of prior sensory input. The stored image is derived from the association of centrally originating predictive signals with peripherally originating sensory input. The predictive signals are probably conveyed by parallel fibers. Recent in vitro experiments have demonstrated that pairing parallel fiber-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) with postsynaptic spikes in Purkinje-like cells depresses the strength of these synapses. The depression has a tight dependence on the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic events. The postsynaptic spike must follow the onset of the epsp within a window of about 60 msec for the depression to occur and pairings at other delays yield a nonassociative enhancement of the epsp. Mathematical analyses and computer simulations are used here to test the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity of the type established in vitro could be responsible for the storage of temporal patterns that is observed in vivo. This hypothesis is confirmed. The temporally asymmetric learning rule established in vitro results in the storage of activity patterns as observed in vivo and does so with significantly greater fidelity than other types of learning rules. The results demonstrate the importance of precise timing in pre- and postsynaptic activity for accurate storage of temporal information.},

	Abstract = {There is increasing recognition that estrogen exerts multifaceted regulatory effects on GnRH neurons. The acute effects of estrogen on calcium dynamics in these cells were examined using a transgenic mouse line that allows real-time measurement of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in GnRH neurons in the acute brain slice preparation. 17-beta-Estradiol (E2) at 100 pm-100 nm was found to activate [Ca2+]i transients in approximately 40% of GnRH neurons with an approximate 15-min latency. This effect was not replicated by E2-BSA, which limits E2 action to the membrane, 17-alpha-estradiol, the inactive isomer at classical estrogen receptors (ERs), or G-1 the GPR30 agonist. E2 continued to activate [Ca2+]i transients when transcription was blocked. An ER alpha-selective agonist was equally potent in activating [Ca2+]i transients, and E2 remained effective in ERbeta knockout x GnRH-Pericam mice. E2&apos;s activation of [Ca2+]i transients continued in the presence of tetrodotoxin, which blocks action potential-dependent transmission, but was abolished completely by the further addition of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor antagonist. Exogenous GABA was found to initiate [Ca2+]i transients in GnRH neurons. Whole cell, voltage-clamp recordings of GnRH-green fluorescence protein neurons revealed that E2 generated discrete bursts of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents with a latency of approximately 15 min. These observations provide evidence for a new mechanism of nonclassical estrogen action within the brain. Estrogen interacts with the classical ERalpha at the level of the GABAergic nerve terminal to regulate action potential-independent GABA release that, in turn, controls postsynaptic calcium dynamics.},

In addition, the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores can result in increased [Ca(2+)](i); the signals that trigger this release have been less well-studied, in part because they are not usually associated with specific changes in membrane potential. However, recent experiments have revealed dramatic widespread Ca(2+) waves and localized spark-like events, particularly in dendrites.

Here we have developed mathematical models for co-expressed dimeric and tetrameric species of receptors. We have considered models where the dimers and tetramers are in equilibrium and where they do not interconvert and we have also considered the potential influence of the ligands on the degree of oligomerization. By analogy with agonist efficacy, we have considered ligands that promote, inhibit or have no effect on oligomerization. Cell surface receptor expression and the intrinsic capacity of receptors to oligomerize are quantitative parameters of the equations. The models can account for differences in the maximal binding capacities of radioligands in different preparations of receptors and provide a conceptual framework for simulation and data fitting in complex oligomeric receptor situations.},

	Abstract = {The cardiac cell is a complex biological system where various processes interact to generate electrical excitation (the action potential, AP) and contraction. During AP generation, membrane ion channels interact nonlinearly with dynamically changing ionic concentrations and varying transmembrane voltage, and are subject to regulatory processes. In recent years, a large body of knowledge has accumulated on the molecular structure of cardiac ion channels, their function, and their modification by genetic mutations that are associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, ion channels are typically studied in isolation (in expression systems or isolated membrane patches), away from the physiological environment of the cell where they interact to generate the AP. A major challenge remains the integration of ion-channel properties into the functioning, complex and highly interactive cell system, with the objective to relate molecular-level processes and their modification by disease to whole-cell function and clinical phenotype. In this article we describe how computational biology can be used to achieve such integration. We explain how mathematical (Markov) models of ion-channel kinetics are incorporated into integrated models of cardiac cells to compute the AP. We provide examples of mathematical (computer) simulations of physiological and pathological phenomena, including AP adaptation to changes in heart rate, genetic mutations in SCN5A and HERG genes that are associated with fatal cardiac arrhythmias, and effects of the CaMKII regulatory pathway and beta-adrenergic cascade on the cell electrophysiological function.},

Slow waves are generated and actively propagated by interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). The initiation of pacemaker activity in the ICC is caused by release of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor-operated stores, uptake of Ca2+ into mitochondria, and the development of unitary currents. Summation of unitary currents causes depolarization and activation of a dihydropyridine-resistant Ca2+ conductance that entrains pacemaker activity in a network of ICC, resulting in the active propagation of slow waves. Slow wave frequency is regulated by a variety of physiological agonists and conditions, and shifts in pacemaker dominance can occur in response to both neural and nonneural inputs. Loss of ICC in many human motility disorders suggests exciting new hypotheses for the etiology of these disorders.},

Even in the simplest possible nonaggregating system, interpretation of the interactions in terms of structural details requires an explicit assumption (or model) for the binding of the ligand to the sites when there are no interactions. This paper develops in detail the processes by which aggregation will yield ligand-dependent cooperativity. Two conceptually distinct free energy differences may contribute to cooperativity in an aggregation reaction. One is the free energy difference in ligand binding between the monomer and the aggregate. The other is derived from ligand-dependent interactions between the sites of the aggregate. In this analysis an explicit distinction is made between the experimentally accessible constants and those derived from assumed models. Experimental measurements of an aggregation cycle in which all of the species in equilibrium are defined do not allow for an evaluation of the energies of interaction without some model (or assumption). In the analysis presented, an explicit assumption is employed relating the constant for binding of the ligand to the isolated monomer and the constant for the binding of the ligand to aggregate under conditions where there are no ligand-dependent interactions.},

In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to define the nature and control of this agonist-enhanced Ca^2^+entry. To date, these studies have largely focussed on the so-called &apos;capacitative&apos; or store-operated model and, although many important details remain unclear, the critical role this mechanism plays in maintaining the sustained elevated &apos;plateau&apos; type of [Ca^2^+]&quot;iresponse seen at high agonist concentrations is now well established. Far less well understood is the nature of the enhanced Ca^2^+entry associated with the more complex [Ca^2^+]&quot;isignals typical of stimulation at more physiological levels of agonist. Where such entry has been considered, it too has generally been assumed to result from a capacitative or &apos;store-operated&apos; mechanism. Significantly, however, direct evidence in support of this assumption is lacking. This review attempts to critically examine this assumption and presents the argument that several key characteristics of capacitative or store-operated mechanisms of agonist-activated Ca^2^+entry are incompatible with its operation during these types of [Ca^2^+]&quot;isignal.},

	Abstract = {Kramers&apos; diffusion theory of reaction rates in the condensed phase is considered as an alternative to the traditional discrete-state Markov (DSM) model in describing ion channel gating current kinetics. Diffusion theory can be expected to be particularly relevant in describing high-frequency (&gt;100kHz) events in channel activation. The generalized voltage sensor of a voltage-dependent ion channel is treated as a Brownian motion particle undergoing spatial diffusion along a one-dimensional energy landscape. Two classes of energy landscapes are considered. The first class contains large barriers, which give rise to gating currents with two distinct time scales: the usual low-frequency decay, which can modeled with a DSM scheme, and a high-frequency component arising from intrastate relaxation. Large depolarizations reduce potential barriers to such a degree that activation rates are diffusion limited, causing the two time scales to merge. Landscapes of the second class are either featureless or contain barriers that are small compared to kT; these are termed &apos;&apos;drift landscapes.&apos;&apos; These landscapes require a larger friction coefficient to generate slow gating kinetics. The high-frequency component that appears with barrier models is not present in pure drift motion. The presence of a high-frequency component can be tested experimentally with large-bandwidth recordings of gating currents. Topics such as frequency domain analysis, spatial dependence of the friction coefficient, methods for determining the adequacy of a DSM model, and the development of physical models of gating are explored.},

	Abstract = {The electrophysiological characteristics of unmodified, postnatal gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the female mouse were studied using whole-cell recordings and single-cell RT-PCR methodology. The GnRH neurons of adult animals fired action potentials and exhibited distinguishable voltage-current relationships in response to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current injections. On the basis of their patterns of inward rectification, rebound depolarization, and ability to fire repetitively, GnRH neurons in intact adult females were categorized into four cell types (type I, 48%; type II, 36%; type III, 11%; type IV, 5%). The GnRH neurons of juvenile animals (15-22 d) exhibited passive membrane properties similar to those of adult GnRH neurons, although only type I (61%) and type II (7%) cells were encountered, in addition to a group of &quot;silent-type&quot; GnRH neurons (32%) that were unable to fire action potentials. A massive, action potential-independent tonic GABA input, signaling through the GABA(A) receptor, was present at all ages. Afterdepolarization and afterhyperpolarization potentials (AHPs) were observed after single action potentials in subpopulations of each GnRH neuron type. Tetrodotoxin (TTX)-independent calcium spikes, as well as AHPs, were encountered more frequently in juvenile GnRH neurons compared with adults. These observations demonstrate the existence of multiple layers of functional heterogeneity in the firing properties of GnRH neurons. Together with pharmacological experiments, these findings suggest that potassium and calcium channels are expressed in a differential manner within the GnRH phenotype. This heterogeneity occurs in a development-specific manner and may underlie the functional maturation and diversity of this unique neuronal phenotype.},

	Abstract = {Usually, the occurrence of random cell behavior is appointed to small copy numbers of molecules involved in the stochastic process. Recently, we demonstrated for a variety of cell types that intracellular Ca2+ oscillations are sequences of random spikes despite the involvement of many molecules in spike generation. This randomness arises from the stochastic state transitions of individual Ca2+ release channels and does not average out due to the existence of steep concentration gradients. The system is hierarchical due to the structural levels channel--channel cluster--cell and a corresponding strength of coupling. Concentration gradients introduce microdomains which couple channels of a cluster strongly. But they couple clusters only weakly; too weak to establish deterministic behavior on cell level. Here, we present a multi-scale modelling concept for stochastic hierarchical systems. It simulates active molecules individually as Markov chains and their coupling by deterministic diffusion. Thus, we are able to follow the consequences of random single molecule state changes up to the signal on cell level. To demonstrate the potential of the method, we simulate a variety of experiments. Comparisons of simulated and experimental data of spontaneous oscillations in astrocytes emphasize the role of spatial concentration gradients in Ca2+ signalling. Analysis of extensive simulations indicates that frequency encoding described by the relation between average and standard deviation of interspike intervals is surprisingly robust. This robustness is a property of the random spiking mechanism and not a result of control.},

The identification of most key elements involved in Ca(2+) signaling enables a mechanistic and quantitative understanding of this particular pathway. Cellular behavior relies in general on the orchestration of molecular behavior leading to reliable cellular responses that allow for regulation and adaptation. Ca(2+) signaling uses a hierarchical organization to transform single molecule behavior into cell wide signals. We have recently shown experimentally that this organization carries single channel signatures onto the whole cell level and renders Ca(2+) oscillations stochastic. Here, we briefly review the co-evolution of experimental and theoretical studies in Ca(2+) -signaling and show how dynamic bottom-up modeling can be used to address -biological questions and illuminate biological principles of cell signaling.},

	Abstract = {The effect of capacitative Ca2+ entry on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) was examined in calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells treated with thapsigargin. Restoration of extracellular Ca2+ evoked an overshoot in [Ca2+]c: the initial rate of Ca2+ influx was 12.4 +/- 0.5 nM/s as [Ca2+]c rose monoexponentially (time constant, tau = 36 +/- 2 s) to a peak (322 +/- 16 nM) before declining to 109 +/- 14 nM after 2000 s. Rates of Ca2+ removal from the cytosol were measured throughout the overshoot by recording the monoexponential decrease in [Ca2+]c after rapid removal of extracellular Ca2+. The time constant for recovery (tau rec decreased from 54 +/- 4 s when Ca2+ was removed after 10 s to its limiting value of 8.8 +/- 1.0 s when it was removed after 2000 s. The time dependence of the changes in tau rec indicate that an increase in [Ca2+]c is followed by a delayed (tau = 408 s) stimulation of Ca2+ removal, which fully reverses (tau approximately 185 s) after Ca2+ entry ceases. Numerical simulation indicated that the changes in Ca2+ removal were largely responsible for the overshooting pattern of [Ca2+]c. Because prolonged (30 min) Ca2+ entry did not increase the total 45Ca2+ content of the cells, an increased rate of Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane most likely mediates the Ca2+ removal, and since it persists in the absence of extracellular Na+, it probably results from stimulation of a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. We conclude that delayed stimulation of a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump by capacitative Ca2+ entry may protect cells from excessive increases in [Ca2+]c and contribute to oscillatory changes in [Ca2+]c.},

The model also accurately simulated: (i) the effect of step changes in basolateral K+ concentration, and the effect of K+ channel blockers on basolateral membrane potential; (ii) the intracellular acidification caused by a Na+-free extracellular solution and the effect of amiloride on this acidification; and (iii) the intracellular alkalinization caused by a Cl--free extracellular solution and the effect of DIDS on this alkalinization. In addition, the model predicted that the luminal Cl- conductance plays a key role in controlling both the HCO-3 secretory rate and intracellular pH during HCO-3 secretion. We believe that the model will be helpful in the analysis of experimental data and improve our understanding of HCO-3-transporting mechanisms in pancreatic duct cells.},

	Abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) takes its name from the pathological changes that occur in the pancreas. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is highly expressed in the pancreatic ductal epithelium and plays a key role in ductal HCO(3)(-) secretion. In humans, the pancreatic duct secretes near isotonic NaHCO(3). Experimental data suggests that HCO(3)(-) secretion occurs via apical Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchangers working in parallel with Cl(-) channels (CFTR and calcium activated chloride channels, CaCC). Programming the currently available experimental data into our computer model (based on network thermodynamics) shows that while the anion exchanger/Cl(-) channel mechanism will produce a relatively large volume of a HCO(3)(-)-rich fluid, it can only raise the luminal HCO(3)(-) concentration up to about 70 mM. To achieve secretion of about 150 mM NaHCO(3) it is necessary to modulate the properties of the apical membrane transporters as the secreted fluid flows down the ductal system. On the basis of our computer simulations, we propose that HCO(3)(-) secretion occurs mainly via the exchanger in duct segments near the acini (luminal HCO(3)(-) concentration up to about 70 mM), but mainly via channels further down the ductal tree (raising luminal HCO(3)(-) to about 150 mM). We speculate that the switch between these two secretory mechanisms is controlled by a series of luminal signals (e.g. pH, HCO(3)(-) concentration) acting on the apical membrane transporters in the duct cell.},

	Abstract = {The expression and function of large-conductance Ca2+ -activated K+ (BK) channels in the GT1-7 line of immortalized gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons was investigated. Ionic currents were recorded using the patch-clamp technique, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was monitored using the fluorescent indicator, fura-2, and GnRH secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay. In cell-attached and inside-out patch-clamp recordings, K+ channels with a single-channel conductance of approximately 200 pS were detected. Depolarizing the patch increased the unitary current size and the open probability. In perforated-patch recordings, depolarizing pulses (50 ms) to potentials of -10 to +60 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV elicited outward current with early transient and sustained components. The transient current peaked 2-10 ms after the beginning of each pulse and increased in a voltage-dependent manner. This current was: (1) unaffected by the small-conductance Ca2+ -activated K+ channel blocker, apamin (100 nM); (2) reduced by the BK channel blocker, charybdotoxin (5 nM); (3) abolished by the Ca2+ channel blocker, CdCl2 (25 mu M), and (4) prolonged by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (1 mu M). Based on the single-channel and whole-cell conductances, the number of channels per patch, the patch area, and the surface area of the cell, each GT1-7 cell contains 30-60 BK channels. The functional role of BK channels in GT1-7 cells was evaluated by measuring the effect of charybdotoxin (100 nM) on basal [Ca2+]i and GnRH secretion, as well as on the [Ca2+]i and GnRH secretory responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 100 mu M), an excitatory neurotransmitter in this system. Charybdotoxin had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i or GnRH secretion, or on the GABA-evoked [Ca2+]i and GnRH secretory responses. These results indicate that GT1-7 cells express BK channels; however, the physiological role of BK channels in GT1-7 cells remains elusive.},

Calcium inhibited r-eag channel activity with a mean IC50 of 67 nM. Activation of muscarinic receptors, generating calcium oscillations in the transfected cells, induced a synchronous inhibition of r-eag mediated outward currents.

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that information in the brain is encoded in temporal spike patterns which are decoded by a combination of time delays and coincidence detection. Here, we show how a multi-compartmental model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell can learn to recognise temporal parallel fibre activity patterns by adapting latencies of calcium responses after activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). In each compartment of our model, the mGluR signalling cascade is represented by a set of differential equations that reflect the underlying biochemistry. Phosphorylation of the mGluRs changes the concentration of receptors which are available for activation by glutamate and thereby adjusts the time delay between mGluR stimulation and voltage response. The adaptation of a synaptic delay as opposed to a weight represents a novel non-Hebbian learning mechanism that can also implement the adaptive timing of the classically conditioned eye-blink response.},

	Abstract = {A remarkable property of Ca2+ fluxes through the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-gated Ca2+ channel is that successive increments of InsP3 induce repeated transient release of accumulated Ca2+. The initial aim of this study was to propose a model, based on hypotheses compatible with the current description of this Ca2+ channel, which could account for such experimental observations. The key feature of the model was the assumption that the Ca(2+)-binding sites on the receptor, whose occupancy leads to immediate channel activation but to subsequent slow channel desensitization, were located somewhere along the permeation pathway and were therefore sensitive to the flux of Ca2+ rather than the cytosolic or luminal Ca2+ concentration per se. Simulation showed that, provided Ca2+ bound to both activating and inhibitory sites with adequate cooperativity, addition of submaximal concentrations InsP3 resulted in transient opening well above the stationary state. The model also rationalized the documented existence of a threshold for InsP3 action, the puzzling control of channel sensitivity to InsP3 by luminal and cytosolic Ca2+, as well as the functional heterogeneity of the Ca2+ pools.},

ICC distributed in muscle bundles play a role as mediators of signals from autonomic nerves to smooth muscle cells. A group of ICC also appears to act as a stretch sensor. Intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics play a crucial role in ICC-MY pacemaking; intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillations periodically activate plasmalemmal Ca(2+)-activated ion channels, such as Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels and/or non-selective cation channels, although the relative contributions of these channels are not defined. With respect to gut motility, both the ICC network and enteric nervous system, including excitatory and inhibitory enteric neurons, play an essential role in producing highly coordinated peristalsis.},

	Abstract = {A simulation of some basic features of Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiac muscle was made with a model based on the mechanism of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release. The half-sarcomere modeled as a circular cylinder was divided into 20 annular elements in the radial, 50 slices in the axial, and 125 slices in the azimuthal direction. The cylindrical surface of the sarcomere was covered by a layer of the SR. The rate of Ca(2+) release from the terminal sac (TS) is proportional to the product of the open probability of the Ca(2+) release channel and the difference of [Ca(2+)] between the TS and an element facing the TS. Ca(2+) moves from element to element by simple diffusion and is taken up by the tubular SR via Ca(2+)-ATPase. Ca(2+) influx (I(ca)) to trigger the TS Ca(2+) release was introduced to either a single element facing the TS (local I(ca)) or to 20 elements aligned at the level of the Z-line (uniform I(ca)). The simulation showed that with both types of I(ca), TS Ca(2+) release is smoothly graded over a wide range of I(ca) with the TS moderately loaded with Ca(2+). The gain determined by dividing the total amount of TS Ca(2+) release by I(ca) was greater with local than with uniform I(ca). Mechanical alternans was simulated with both the local and uniform I(ca) with an appropriate rate of Ca(2+) replenishment to the TS. A Ca(2+) wave was simulated with a model consisting of 8 longitudinally consecutive sarcomeres with TS heavily loaded with Ca(2+). Thus the present model accounted for graded TS Ca(2+) release, mechanical alternans, and Ca(2+) wave in cardiac muscle at the same time.},

	Abstract = {The conventional alternating access model for Ca2+ transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump is modified, partly on the basis of the proposed MacLennan-Green domain structure for the Ca2+-pump protein. The present model divides the uptake state (E1) of the protein into three substates, differing in the condition of the Ca2+-binding domain. The domain is an open cavity in the first substate and can bind only a single Ca2+ ion. A fast &quot;jaw-closing&quot; (or &quot;hinge-bending&quot;) step then partially closes the cavity to generate the second substate that has a second Ca2+-binding site. Occupation of this site is followed by another jaw-closing step that closes the binding cavity and occludes the bound ions. The subsequent translocation step (to form E2) remains unchanged from previous models. The modified model predicts a constant transport stoichiometry of two Ca2+ per pump reaction cycle. It suggests a plausible mechanism for coupling between Ca2+ binding and ATP utilization: the model predicts (in agreement with experiment) that Ca2+ binding should be a mandatory requirement for phosphorylation of the pump protein, though ATP binding per se does not require Ca2+. The model is consistent with high cooperativity in equilibrium binding of Ca2+, both in the absence and presence of ATP.},

	Abstract = {In many cell types, low concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) release only a portion of the intracellular IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store, a phenomenon known as &quot;quantal&quot; Ca2+ release. It has been suggested that this effect is a result of reduced activity of the IP3-dependent Ca2+ channel with decreasing calcium concentration within the IP3-sensitive store ([Ca2+]s). To test this hypothesis, the properties of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release in single saponin-permeabilized HSY cells were studied by monitoring [Ca2+]s using the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye mag-fura-2. In permeabilized cells, blockade of the sarco/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase pump in stores partially depleted by IP3 induced further Ca2+ release via an IP3-dependent route, indicating that Ca2+ entry via the sarco/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase pump had been balanced by Ca2+ loss via the IP3-sensitive channel before pump inhibition. IP3-dependent Mn2+ entry, monitored via quenching of luminal mag-fura-2 fluorescence, was readily apparent in filled stores but undetectable in Ca(2+)-depleted stores, indicating markedly reduced IP3-sensitive channel activity in the latter. Also consistent with reduced responsiveness of Ca(2+)-depleted stores to IP3, the initial rate of refilling of these stores was unaffected by the presence of 0.3 microM IP3, a concentration that was clearly effective in eliciting Ca2+ release from filled stores. Analysis of the rate of Ca2+ release at various IP3 concentrations indicated a significant shift of the IP3 dose response toward higher [IP3] with decreasing [Ca2+]s. We conclude that IP3-dependent Ca2+ release in HSY cells is a steady-state process wherein Ca2+ efflux via the IP3 receptor Ca2+ channel is regulated by [Ca2+]s, apparently via changes in the sensitivity of the channel to IP3.},

The associated openings and closings of the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ release channel were detected via quenching of Mag-fura-2 fluorescence due to the entry of Mn2+, a Ca2+ surrogate, into the stores. Evidence for complimentary Ca2+ oscillations at the external surface of the stores was provided by the membrane-bound Ca2+ probe Calcium Green C18. The permeabilization of saponin-treated HSY cells to macromolecules was confirmed by demonstrating that permeabilized cells readily took up and lost (t1/2 approximately 46 s) a fluorescently tagged 70-kDa dextran. Our results impose a number of constraints on possible mechanisms for [Ca2+]i oscillations. In addition, they support recent proposals that [Ca2+]i oscillations arise directly from the (biphasic) effects of Ca2+ itself on IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channel activity.},

Introduction of hippocalcin in cultured hippocampal neurons leads to a pronounced I(sAHP), while neurons expressing a hippocalcin mutant lacking N-terminal myristoylation exhibit a small I(sAHP) that is similar to that recorded in uninfected neurons. This implies that hippocalcin must bind to the plasma membrane to mediate its effects. These findings support a model in which the calcium sensor for the sAHP channels is not preassociated with the channel complex.},

	Abstract = {Sodium channel gating behavior was modeled with Markovian models fitted to currents from the cut-open squid giant axon in the absence of divalent cations. Optimum models were selected with maximum likelihood criteria using single-channel data, then models were refined and extended by simultaneous fitting of macroscopic ionic currents, ON and OFF gating currents, and single-channel first latency densities over a wide voltage range. Best models have five closed states before channel opening, with inactivation from at least one closed state as well as the open state. Forward activation rate constants increase with depolarization, and deactivation rate constants increase with hyperpolarization. Rates of inactivation from the open or closed states are generally slower than activation or deactivation rates and show little or no voltage dependence. Channels tend to reopen several times before inactivating. Macroscopic rates of activation and inactivation result from a combination of closed, open and inactivated state transitions. At negative potentials the time to first opening dominates the macroscopic current due to slow activation rates compared with deactivation rates: channels tend to reopen rarely, and often inactivate from closed states before they reopen. At more positive potentials, the time to first opening and burst duration together produce the macroscopic current.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a simple mathematical model with three physiologically significant states to describe the changes in intrauterine pressure associated with a contraction during human parturition. The myometrium is modelled as a set of smooth muscle cells, each of which is in one of three states (quiescent, contracted, refractory) at a given time. These states are occupied according to a cycle governed by three temporal parameters. The solutions of the equations describing the model show an oscillatory behavior for particular values of these parameters, which is very similar to the time dependent development of intrauterine pressure during labor. Due to its non-linear terms, our model could lead to chaotic oscillations (in the mathematical sense), whose clinical counterpart may occur in cases of dystocia. Despite its simplicity, this model appears to be a useful guide to further investigations of the oscillatory behavior of the myometrium, or other smooth muscles, in normal and pathological situations.},

In patients not receiving hormone treatment, the dynamic behavior could be described using a three-state model similar to the one we have already used to explain the oscillations of intrauterine pressure during parturition. However, the shape of the spontaneous contractions of myometrium from patients on progestin treatment was different, due to a two-step relaxation regime including a latched phase which cannot be simulated using the previous model without introducing an ad hoc mechanism to account for the extra energy involved in this sustained contraction. One way to do this is to introduce an anomalous rate of ATP consumption, the biochemical reasons for which have not yet been elucidated and which cannot be mathematically simulated using our experimental data. An alternative explanation is the reduced cycling rate of actin-myosin cross-bridges known to occur during the latch-phase. Our experimental findings suggest a third possibility, namely a sol-gel transition with a specific relaxation time constant, which would maintain a significant part of the cell population in the contracted-state until the intracellular-medium returns to its normal fluid behavior.},

	Abstract = {In many cell types, receptor stimulation evokes cytosolic calcium oscillations with a frequency that depends on agonist dose. Previous studies demonstrated controversial effects of changing the activity of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca^2^+-ATPase upon the frequency of oscillations. By numerical simulations, we found that the model of De Young and Keizer (Keizer and De Young, 1994), unlike other models, can explain the observed discrepancies, assuming that the different experiments were performed at different stimulus levels. According to model predictions, partial inhibition of internal calcium pumps is expected to increase frequency at low stimulus strength and should have an opposite effect at strong stimuli. Similar results were obtained using an analytical estimation of oscillation period, based on calcium-dependent channel activation and inactivation. In experiments on HeLa cells, 4nM thapsigargin increased the frequency of calcium oscillations induced by 1 and 2.5@mM histamine but had no effect on supramaximally stimulated cells. In HEp-2 cells, 2 nM thapsigargin slowed down the rapid, ATP-induced oscillations. Our results suggest that in the investigated cell types, the De Young-Keizer model based on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent calcium-induced calcium release can properly describe intracellular calcium oscillations.},

The biotin/avidin cross-linked gel, whose behavior is determined by polymer bending alone, behaves like a solid and shows no frequency dependence. The amoeba alpha-actinin cross-linked gel behaves like a viscoelastic fluid, and the frequency dependence of the stiffness can be explained by a mathematical model for dynamically cross-linked gels. The stiffness of the chicken alpha-actinin cross-linked gel is independent of frequency, and has viscoelastic properties intermediate between the two. The two alpha-actinins have similar association rate constants for binding to actin filaments, consistent with a diffusion-limited reaction. Rigid cross-links make the gel stiff, but make it elastic without the ability to deform permanently. Dynamically cross-linked actin filaments should allow the cell to react passively to various outside forces without any sort of signaling. Slower, signal-mediated pathways, such as severing filaments or changing the affinity of cross-linkers, could alter the nature of these passive reactions.},

Toward this end we demonstrated that the parotid slice is a significant addition to the repertoire of tools available to investigators to probe exocrine structure and function since there is currently no cell culture system that fully recapitulates parotid acinar cell biology. Importantly, we show that a subpopulation of the acinar cells of parotid slices can be maintained in short-term culture and retain their morphology and function for up to 2 days. This in vitro model system is a significant step forward compared with enzymatically dispersed acini that rapidly lose their morphological and functional characteristics over several hours, and it was shown to be long enough for the expression and trafficking of exogenous protein following adenoviral infection.

	Abstract = {Regulation of periciliary liquid (PCL) depth is of central importance to mucociliary clearance by the airway epithelium. Without adequate hydration mucociliary transport would cease, leading to build up of mucus in the airways, and impairing the clearance of any trapped inhaled particulates. Airway epithelial cells are known to release ATP under a number of stress conditions. Cell surface receptors bind ATP and trigger an intracellular calcium response which regulates the gating of specific ion channels on the apical and basolateral cell membranes. This shifts the electrochemical balance, resulting in the accumulation of Na(+) and Cl(-) in the periciliary liquid, and providing an osmotic driving force for water flux. In this study, we present a mathematical model of a single airway epithelial cell which describes the fluid secretion elicited after a rise in intracellular calcium. The model provides a basis to quantitatively analyse the influence of intracellular calcium signalling on fluid movement. The model demonstrates behaviour consistent with a number of experimental data on manipulating periciliary liquid volume and tonicity, and provides a quantitative basis for analysing the role of the different membrane ion channels in determining water flux following different physiological stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Airway epithelium has been shown to exhibit intracellular calcium waves after mechanical stimulation. Two classes of mechanism have been proposed to explain calcium wave propagation: diffusion through gap junctions of the intracellular messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and diffusion of paracrine extracellular messengers such as ATP. We have used single cell recordings of airway epithelium to parameterize a model of an airway epithelial cell. This was then incorporated into a spatial model of a cell culture where both mechanisms for calcium wave propagation are possible. It is shown that a decreasing return on the radius of Ca2+ wave propagation is achieved as the amount of ATP released from the stimulated cell increases. It is therefore shown that for a Ca2+ wave to propagate large distances, a significant fraction of the intracellular ATP pool would be required to be released. Further to this, the radial distribution of maximal calcium response from the stimulated cell does not produce the same flat profile of maximal calcium response seen in experiential studies. This suggests that an additional mechanism is important in Ca2+ wave propagation, such as regenerative release of ATP from cells downstream of the stimulated cell.},

Fluid secreted by the airway epithelium is used to maintain the depth of the periciliary liquid (PCL) above the apical membrane of the epithelial cells lining the bronchial airways. Previous mathematical models have been published which separately consider the electrophysiology involved in regulating periciliary liquid depth, and the transmission of intracellular calcium waves in airway epithelial tissue. In this paper we present a mathematical model that combines these previous models and allows the effect of oscillations in intracellular calcium on fluid secretion by airway epithelial cells to be investigated. We show that an oscillatory calcium response produces different fluid secretion properties to that elicited by a tonic rise in intracellular calcium.

In transit through the secretory pathway, these enzymes are separated from constitutively secreted proteins and packaged into zymogen granules, which are localised in the apical pole of the cell. Stimulation of the cell by secretagogues such as acetylcholine and cholecystokinin, acting at receptors on the basolateral plasma membrane, causes the generation of an intracellular Ca(2+) signal. This signal, in turn, triggers the fusion of the zymogen granules with the apical plasma membrane, leading to the polarised secretion of the enzymes. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the control of secretion in the acinar cell. In particular, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the sorting of digestive enzymes into the zymogen granules, the molecular components of the exocytotic &quot;membrane fusion machine,&quot; the generation and propagation of the Ca(2+ signal and the development of new techniques for the visualisation of single granule fusion events.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) of the rat has been developed that is suitable for simulating luminal buffer titration and ammonia secretion by this nephron segment. Luminal proton secretion has been assigned to an H-K-ATPase, which has been represented by adapting the kinetic model of the gastric enzyme by Brzezinski et al. (P. Brzezinski, B. G. Malmstrom, P. Lorentzon, and B. Wallmark. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 942: 215-219, 1988). In shifting to a 2 H+:1 ATP stoichiometry, the model enzyme can acidify the tubule lumen approximately 3 pH units below that of the cytosol, when luminal K+ is in abundance. Peritubular base exit is a combination of ammonia recycling and HCO3- flux (either via Cl-/HCO3- exchange or via a Cl- channel). Ammonia recycling involves NH4(+) uptake on the Na-K-ATPase followed by diffusive NH3 exit [S. M. Wall. Am. J. Physiol. 270 (Renal Physiol. 39): F432-F439, 1996]; model calculations suggest that this is the principal mode of base exit. By virtue of this mechanism, the model also suggests that realistic elevations in peritubular K+ concentration will compromise IMCD acid secretion. Although ammonia recycling is insensitive to carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition, the base exit linked to HCO3- flux provides a CA-sensitive component to acid secretion. In model simulations, it is observed that increased luminal NaCl entry increases ammonia cycling but decreases peritubular Cl-/HCO3- exchange (due to increased cell Cl-). This parallel system of peritubular base exit stabilizes acid secretion in the face of variable Na+ reabsorption.},

	Abstract = {A standing gradient model of the lateral intercellular space is presented which includes a basement membrane of finite solute permeability. The solution to the model equations is estimated analytically using the &quot;isotonic convection approximation&quot; of Segel. In the case of solute pumps uniformly distributed along the length of the channel, the achievement of isotonic transport depends only on the water permeability of the cell membranes. The ability of the model to transport water against an adverse osmotic gradient is the sum of two terms: The first term is simply that for a well-stirred compartment model and reflects basement membrane solute permeability. The second term measures the added strength due to diffusion limitation within the interspace. It is observed, however, that the ability for uphill water transport due to diffusion limitation is diminished by high cell membrane water permeability. For physiologically relevant parameters, it appears that the high water permeability required for isotonic transport renders the contribution of the standing gradient relatively ineffective in transport against an osmotic gradient. Finally, when the model transports both isotonically and against a gradient, it is shown that substantial intraepithelial solute polarization effects are unavoidable. Thus, the measured epithelial water permeability will grossly underestimate the water permeability of the cell membranes. The accuracy of the analytic approximation is demonstrated by numerical solution of the complete model equations.},

In particular, it is shown that the concentration of the transported fluid in the presence of exactly equal bathing media is, in general, not a sufficient calculation by which to decide the issue of isotonicity of transport. Within this framework, two epithelial models are considered: (1) A nonelectrolyte compartment model of the lateral intercellular space is presented along with its linearization about the condition of zero flux. This latter approximate model is shown to be useful in the estimation of deviation from isotonicity, intraepithelial solute polarization effects, and the capacity to transport water against a gradient. In the case of uphill water transport, some limitations of a model of fixed geometry are indicated and the advantage of modeling a compliant interspace is suggested. (2) A comprehensive model of cell and channel is described which includes the major electrolytes and the possible presence of intraepithelial gradients. The general approach to verification of isotonicity is illustrated for this numerical model. In addition, the insights about parameter dependence gained from the linear compartment model are shown to be applicable to understanding this large simulation.},

	Abstract = {Critical to epithelial cell viability is the homeostasis of cell volume and composition during changes in transcellular transport. In this study, two previously developed mathematical models (principal cell of the collecting duct and proximal tubule cell) are approximated by their linearizations about a reference condition. This yields matrices which estimate cell volume, cell composition, and transcellular fluxes in response to perturbations of bath conditions and membrane transporter activity. These approximations are themselves extended with the inclusion of linear dependence of membrane transport coefficients on cell variables (e.g., volume, solute concentrations, or electrical potential). This provides cell models with variable permeabilities, which may be homeostatic, and which can be examined systematically: sequentially testing each membrane permeability and its controlling cell variable. In the proximal tubule approximation, volume-mediated increases in peritubular K-Cl or Na-3HCO3 cotransport, and volume-mediated decreases in Na,K-ATPase activity are homeostatic; modulation of peritubular K permeability has little impact. In the principal cell model, volume homeostasis is afforded by volume-sensitive peritubular Na/H exchange or Cl- conductance. Predictions from the linear analysis are confirmed in the full models. This approach yields a systematic examination of homeostasis in an epithelial model, and identifies candidate control parameters.},

	Abstract = {In part I of this series of papers, we described the cubic ternary complex (CTC) model. In part II, we examine the pharmacological notion of apparent ligand affinity in the light of this model. The high degree of symmetry that characterizes the CTC model makes it possible to use simple geometrical devices to visualize chemical transitions. This geometric point of view provides a motivation for the development of a biological interpretation for apparent affinity.Using this geometrical point of view, an analytical expression for apparent ligand affinity is derived that can be applied to any receptor-occupancy model. When unbound receptors are distributed among a number of states, apparent affinity is a composite measure, a weighted average of the affinities that a ligand has for each of the receptor states. In general, apparent affinity can be interpreted as the mathematical expectation of the simple affinities of members of a native receptor ensemble. The &apos;&apos;expectation&apos;&apos; method of computing affinity is algebraically equivalent to an even simpler computational method, here called the &apos;&apos;diagonalization&apos;&apos; method. The use of each method is demonstrated.The CTC model corroborates what other models and some experimental work have previously suggested. Affinity, as it is calculated experimentally for G-protein-coupled receptors, is not purely a receptor property but is a function both of the receptor and of the suite of transitional proteins with which the receptor interacts},

A precise formulation of efficacy only exists for very simple pharmacological models. Here we extend the notion of efficacy to models that incorporate receptor activation and G-protein coupling. Using the cubic ternary complex model, we show that efficacy is not purely a property of the ligand-receptor interaction; it also depends upon the distributional details of the receptor species in the native receptor ensemble. This suggests a distinction between what we call potential efficacy (a vector) and realized efficacy (a scalar).To each receptor species in the native receptor ensemble we assign a part-worth utility; taken together these utilities comprise the potential efficacy vector. Realized efficacy is the expectation of these part-worth utilities with respect to the frequency distribution of receptor species in the native receptor ensemble. In the parlance of statistical decision theory, the binding of a ligand to a receptor ensemble is a random prospect and realized efficacy is the utility of this prospect. We explore the implications that our definition of efficacy has for understanding agonism and in assessing the legitimacy of the bipartite view in pharmacology.},

The list of systems where receptor aggregation appears to be important in understanding ligand binding and cellular responses is growing rapidly. In this paper we explore the interpretation of equilibrium binding data for aggregating receptor systems. The Scatchard plot is a widely used tool for analyzing equilibrium binding data. The shape of the Scatchard plot is often interpreted in terms of multiple noninteracting receptor populations. Such an analysis does not provide a framework for investigating the role of receptor aggregation and will be misleading if there is a relation between receptor aggregation and ligand binding. We present a general model for the equilibrium binding of a ligand with any number of aggregating receptor populations and derive theoretical expressions for observable Scatchard plot features. These can be used to test particular models and estimate model parameters. We develop particular models and apply the general results in the cases of six aggregating receptor systems where ligand binding and receptor aggregation are related: cross-linking of monovalent cell surface proteins by monoclonal antibodies, cross-linking of cell surface antibodies by bivalent ligand, antibody-induced co-cross-linking of cell surface antibodies and Fc gamma receptors, ligand-enhanced aggregation of identical epidermal growth factor receptors, aggregation of heterologous receptors for interleukin 2 to form a high-affinity receptor, and association of receptors, including those for interleukins 5 and 6, with nonbinding accessory proteins that influence receptor affinity or effector function.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) signals are central to the mechanisms underlying fluid and protein secretion in pancreatic and parotid acinar cells. Calcium release was studied in natively buffered cells following focal laser photolysis of caged molecules. Focal photolysis of caged-inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP(3)) in the apical region resulted in Ca(2+) release from the apical trigger zone and, after a latent period, the initiation of an apical-to-basal Ca(2+) wave. The latency was longer and the wave speed significantly slower in pancreatic compared with parotid cells. Focal photolysis in basal regions evoked only limited Ca(2+) release at the photolysis site and never resulted in a propagating wave. Instead, an apical-to-basal wave was initiated following a latent period. Again, the latent period was significantly longer under all conditions in pancreas than parotid. Although slower in pancreas than parotid, once initiated, the apical-to-basal wave speed was constant in a particular cell type. Photo release of caged-Ca(2+) failed to evoke a propagating Ca(2+) wave in either cell type. However, the kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal evoked following photolysis of caged-InsP(3) were significantly dampened by ryanodine in parotid but not pancreas, indicating a more prominent functional role for ryanodine receptor (RyR) following InsP(3) receptor (InsP(3)R) activation. These data suggest that differing expression levels of InsP(3)R, RyR, and possibly cellular buffering capacity may contribute to the fast kinetics of Ca(2+) signals in parotid compared with pancreas. These properties may represent a specialization of the cell type to effectively stimulate Ca(2+)-dependent effectors important for the differing primary physiological role of each gland.},

	Abstract = {The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of smooth muscles presents many intriguing facets and questions concerning its roles, especially as these change with development, disease, and modulation of physiological activity. The SR&apos;s function was originally perceived to be synthetic and then that of a Ca store for the contractile proteins, acting as a Ca amplification mechanism as it does in striated muscles. Gradually, as investigators have struggled to find a convincing role for Ca-induced Ca release in many smooth muscles, a role in controlling excitability has emerged. This is the Ca spark/spontaneous transient outward current coupling mechanism which reduces excitability and limits contraction. Release of SR Ca occurs in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, Ca, and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and depletion of SR Ca can initiate Ca entry, the mechanism of which is being investigated but seems to involve Stim and Orai as found in nonexcitable cells. The contribution of the elemental Ca signals from the SR, sparks and puffs, to global Ca signals, i.e., Ca waves and oscillations, is becoming clearer but is far from established. The dynamics of SR Ca release and uptake mechanisms are reviewed along with the control of luminal Ca. We review the growing list of the SR&apos;s functions that still includes Ca storage, contraction, and relaxation but has been expanded to encompass Ca homeostasis, generating local and global Ca signals, and contributing to cellular microdomains and signaling in other organelles, including mitochondria, lysosomes, and the nucleus. For an integrated approach, a review of aspects of the SR in health and disease and during development and aging are also included. While the sheer versatility of smooth muscle makes it foolish to have a &quot;one model fits all&quot; approach to this subject, we have tried to synthesize conclusions wherever possible.},

	Abstract = {Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs) are exceptionally well adapted to subserve diverse physiological roles, from epithelial fluid transport to sensory transduction, because their gating is cooperatively controlled by the interplay between ionotropic and metabotropic signals. A molecular understanding of the dual regulation of CaCCs by voltage and Ca(2+) has recently become possible with the discovery that Ano1 (TMEM16a) is an essential subunit of CaCCs. Ano1 can be gated by Ca(2+) or by voltage in the absence of Ca(2+), but Ca(2+)- and voltage-dependent gating are very closely coupled. Here we identify a region in the first intracellular loop that is crucial for both Ca(2+) and voltage sensing. Deleting (448)EAVK in the first intracellular loop dramatically decreases apparent Ca(2+) affinity. In contrast, mutating the adjacent amino acids (444)EEEE abolishes intrinsic voltage dependence without altering the apparent Ca(2+)affinity. Voltage-dependent gating of Ano1 measured in the presence of intracellular Ca(2+) was facilitated by anions with high permeability or by an increase in [Cl(-)](e). Our data show that the transition between closed and open states is governed by Ca(2+) in a voltage-dependent manner and suggest that anions allosterically modulate Ca(2+)-binding affinity. This mechanism provides a unified explanation of CaCC channel gating by voltage and ligand that has long been enigmatic.},

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional presynaptic calcium diffusion model developed to account for characteristics of transmitter release was modified to provide for binding of calcium to a receptor and subsequent triggering of exocytosis. When low affinity (20 microM) and rapid kinetics were assumed for the calcium receptor triggering exocytosis, and stimulus parameters were selected to match those of experiments, the simulations predicted a virtual invariance of the time course of transmitter release to paired stimulation, stimulation with pulses of different amplitude, and stimulation in different calcium solutions. The large temperature sensitivity of experimental release time course was explained by a temperature sensitivity of the model&apos;s final rate limiting exocytotic process. Inclusion of calcium tail currents and a saturable buffer with finite binding kinetics resulted in high peak calcium transients near release sites, exceeding 100 microM. Models with a single class of calcium binding site to the secretory trigger molecule failed to produce sufficient synaptic facilitation under this condition. When at least one calcium ion binds to a different site having higher affinity and slow kinetics, facilitation again reaches levels similar to those seen experimentally. It is possible that the neurosecretory trigger molecule reacts with calcium at more than one class of binding site.},

	Abstract = {The inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptor (InsP(3)R) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular Ca(2+) channel that mediates complex cytoplasmic Ca(2+) signals, regulating diverse cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity. Activation of the InsP(3)R channel is normally thought to require binding of InsP(3) derived from receptor-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol lipid hydrolysis. Here we identify a family of neuronal Ca(2+)-binding proteins as high-affinity protein agonists of the InsP(3)R, which bind to the channel and activate gating in the absence of InsP(3). CaBP/caldendrin, a subfamily of the EF-hand-containing neuronal calcium sensor family of calmodulin-related proteins, bind specifically to the InsP(3)-binding region of all three InsP(3)R channel isoforms with high affinity (K(a) approximately 25 nM) in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner (K(a) approximately 1 microM). Binding activates single-channel gating as efficaciously as InsP(3), dependent on functional EF-hands in CaBP. In contrast, calmodulin neither bound with high affinity nor activated channel gating. CaBP1 and the type 1 InsP(3)R associate in rat whole brain and cerebellum lysates, and colocalize extensively in subcellular regions in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Thus, InsP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in cells is possible even in the absence of InsP(3) generation, a process that may be particularly important in responding to and shaping changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration by InsP(3)-independent pathways and for localizing InsP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signals to individual synapses.},

	Abstract = {This article describes the action potential-calcium wave hypothesis of uterine contractility. Two known mechanisms of intercellular tissue-level signaling are merged into a single hypothesis of organ-level signaling. This hypothesis provides a framework with which to link cellular physiology with organ function. The two mechanisms of tissue-level signaling considered are action potential propagation and intercellular calcium waves. A great body of literature exists regarding the electrical excitability of smooth muscle and myometrium. Despite this knowledge, it does not seem possible to reconcile the familiar uterine contraction profile with known parameters of cellular physiology unless a second mechanism of intercellular communication is postulated. Intercellular calcium waves fit the requirements needed for the second mechanism: slow speed, ability to raise intracellular free calcium, and ability to signal over hundreds of micrometers. The premise of the action potential-calcium wave hypothesis is that action potentials propagate rapidly throughout the uterus, initiating intercellular calcium waves. As the intercellular calcium waves propagate slowly through the bundles, myocytes are recruited to participate in the contraction. This article reviews and summarizes the literature on calcium waves in human myometrium and presents evidence to support the combination of these mechanisms. Extension of the hypothesis suggests that the functional unit of the laboring human uterus is the smooth-muscle bundle, and that the frequency and strength of uterine contractions are separate but linked physiologic characteristics of labor.},

	Abstract = {Ca2+ waves are rises of intracellular free Ca2+ that occur in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner, such that a leading edge of a wave front can be clearly discerned. Waves that occur within the bounds of a single cell are termed intracellular Ca2+ waves. Generation of a Ca2+ wave may be the end result of multiple cellular signalling events and, consequently, is a mechanism of signal integration or information processing. Passage of a Ca2+ wave is a mechanism for signalling within a cell, or across a cell. This paper reviews intracellular Ca2+ waves and their relationship with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in uterine smooth muscle. Wave speeds are the rate at which the leading front of the Ca2+ wave travels, and are measured by time-lapse imaging of Ca2+-dependent fluorescent dyes. Waves can be experimentally generated in cultured cells by agonist or mechanical stimulation. Wave speeds are unaffected by the removal of Ca2+ in the bathing solution, indicating that the source of the Ca2+ is the SR. The mechanisms of intracellular wave propagation can be investigated by modulating the Ca2+ release mechanisms of the SR. The mechanism most consistent with our observations is that propagation of intracellular Ca2+ waves in cultured human uterine myocytes is SR Ca2+ release that can utilize InsP3 receptors alone, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release receptors alone, or both together. The rate-determining step for Ca2+ wave propagation is diffusion of Ca2+ through a highly buffered cytoplasm. Passage of a Ca2+ wave also results in capacitative Ca2+ entry, which links deep cytoplasmic Ca2+ changes to subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentrations.},

To promote the concept that we have a relatively poor understanding of the physiology of parturition, we will posit 10 facts that are so obvious and so clearly accepted as facts that they probably are not even facts at all. (1) The laboring uterus undergoes peristalsis to dilate the cervix, deliver the fetus, and expel the placenta. (2) The human uterus is composed of longitudinal and circular layers of smooth muscle. (3) The functional cells of the uterus are the myocytes, which are a homogeneous cell type responsible for the generation of contraction forces, passage of action potentials, and control of contractility. (4) The phasic contractions of the uterus are typical for visceral smooth muscle. (5) The primary, and perhaps only, role of gap junctions is to allow passage of action potentials through the tissue. (6) Action potential propagation as the mechanism for global communication (over many centimeters throughout the uterus) is sufficient to recruit all regions and all myocytes of the uterus. (7) Slow waves pace the contractions of human myometrium. (8) Calcium-activated potassium channels are responsible for repolarization of the membrane potential that terminates each contraction. (9) Chloride channels are not important in uterine electrophysiology. (10) With enough computing power, it would be straightforward to build a closed model of human labor, given our current understanding of the components of myometrium.

We correlated the number of spikes, durations of spiking activity, and the spiking frequencies with changes of the area under the force curves as a function of exposure to low doses of anthracene-9-carboxylate (9-AC, a non-specific Cl channel blocker), chlorotoxin (a specific I(Cl(Ca)) blocker) and nifedipine (an L-type calcium channel blocker). The area under the force curve was measured only during spiking electrical activity, thereby separating pharmacological effects on tissue relaxation from those that modulate force production. Blocking chloride channels reduced impulse, shortened the duration of spiking activity, and reduced the number of spikes generated in each contraction. This was observed without a change in the frequency of spike production or a reduction of peak force. Nifedipine reduced impulse, shortened the duration of spiking activity, and reduced the number of spikes. In contrast to chloride channel blockade, nifedipine reduced maximum spike frequency and peak force. Taken together, our data suggest that blocking L-type calcium channels reduces impulse directly by reducing peak force, and indirectly by reducing activation of I(Cl(Ca)) , which shortens the duration of the contraction.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium stores of human uterine myocytes in primary and second passage cell culture were visualized using the low-affinity calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, fluo-3FF. The calcium stores appeared as numerous small (0.2-0.5 microm diameter) focal fluorescences. The stores were not depleted by exposing the cells to oxytocin or ryanodine under standard conditions. The stores were rapidly depleted by oxytocin or ryanodine exposure when sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium re-uptake was inhibited by pretreatment with thapsigargin. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that both ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors were smoothly distributed throughout the SR, and neither receptor co-localized with the calcium stores. Since IP(3) and ryanodine calcium channels are tightly associated with their receptor, these results suggest that SR calcium release occurs via second messenger channels that are remote from the SR calcium stores. These observations are consistent only with a mechanism for release of calcium stores where the SR serves three functions: (1) as site of calcium storage, (2) as the structure that contains the IP(3)- and ryanodine receptors and their associated release channels, and (3) as a conduit between the calcium stores and the release channels.},

	Abstract = {The plasma membrane contains the key elements for the control of coupling excitation to contraction in smooth muscle. The superficial calcium buffer barrier, initially proposed by van Breemen for vascular smooth muscle, may participate in the regulation of calcium entry in other smooth muscle types. To investigate the relationship between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the plasma membrane in myometrial smooth muscle cells, we performed experiments using videofluorescence imaging and cell-attached electrophysiology. The cell-attached patch was used as a reporter for the free calcium in the subplasmalemmal space by monitoring openings of the Maxi-K channel. Calcium green-1 was used to simultaneously monitor changes of the deep cytosolic calcium concentrations. The cell with the patch attached was stimulated via an intercellular calcium wave from an adjacent cell. In this fashion, release of SR calcium was accomplished with minimal disturbance of the plasma membrane and the subplasmalemmal space of the cell studied. With physiological bathing solution, six of seven calcium waves activated Maxi-K channels. Surprisingly, the Maxi-K channels began opening 6.3 +/- 4.7s (range 2.6-15.0s) after the wave passed the pipette location. When plasma membrane calcium fluxes were inhibited with 100 microM lanthanum, no Maxi-K channel openings were observed in six of seven experiments. These results are best explained by a subplasmalemmal space in which the calcium concentration is largely controlled by store-operated channels. These results suggest the superficial buffer barrier as merely one aspect of subplasmalemmal regulation of calcium dynamics, and emphasize the importance of store-operated calcium channels during dynamic calcium changes.},

	Abstract = {Cultured human myocytes exhibit intercellular calcium waves that travel farther than 100 microm (&apos;far waves&apos;). This work investigates the mechanism of far wave propagation. Culture lines were initiated from myometrial biopsies of term pregnant women. Calcium green-1 was used as a fluorescence probe for intracellular free calcium. Serial imaging was performed at a frame rate of 0.83 frames/s. Intercellular calcium waves were mechanically initiated by atraumatically applying small drops of mineral oil onto the surface of the monolayer. Each intercellular calcium wave was scored using a standardized grid, and points were assigned depending upon the distance the wave traveled and the fluorescent intensity observed within each region. Experiments were performed in the presence of inhibitors of gap junctions and connexin hemichannels (octanol), ATP (apyrase and MDL 12330 A), prostaglandins (indomethacin, high concentrations of lanthanum), the prostaglandin transporter, PGT (DIDS), and transmembrane calcium flux (low concentrations of lanthanum). Octanol, apyrase and MDL 12330 A failed to modify the far waves, indicating gap junctions, connexin hemichannels and ATP do not participate in the paracrine mechanism. Indomethacin at 30, 100 and 300 microM, in a dose dependent manner, reduced the far wave score to 0, suggesting a prostaglandin was critically involved in the mechanism. DIDS reduced the far wave score, but did not fully inhibit wave propagation, suggesting the presence of PGT-dependent and -independent components to the mechanism. Lanthanum at 0.1 mM had no effect, but at 1 mM, reduced the far wave score. These results are consistent with PGF2alpha and/or PGE2 being the signal molecule for the PGT-dependent component. Taken together, these data indicate that long distance intercellular calcium waves in cultured human myocytes utilizes a paracrine signaling mechanism, but with more than one extracellular signaling compound.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to characterize the types of voltage-activated calcium currents that are found in human uterine myocytes and to determine the effects of magnesium and nifedipine on these currents. STUDY DESIGN: Electrophysiologic experiments were performed on freshly isolated human uterine smooth muscle cells by means of the nystatin modification of the whole-cell patch clamp technique. RESULTS: Two types of voltage-activated calcium currents that are similar to the T-type and L-type calcium currents observed in cardiac myocytes were identified in freshly dispersed, pregnant human uterine myocytes. Magnesium at 8 mmol/L reduced uterine myocyte T-type currents by 68% +/- 17% but did not reduce L-type currents. Nifedipine at 10(-6) mol/L blocked the L-type currents but had no effect on T-type currents. CONCLUSION: Freshly isolated human uterine smooth muscle cells exhibit subtypes of calcium currents that are analogous to those found in cardiac myocytes. The uterine myocyte T-type current may be primarily involved with action potential transmission and the L-type current primarily with increasing intracellular free calcium by bulk calcium transport. The differing physiologic effects of magnesium and nifedipine on the calcium current subtypes suggest that for the treatment of preterm labor the primary effect of magnesium therapy is to decrease the frequency of contractions and of nifedipine the strength.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this work was to determine the relative importance of sarcoplasmic reticulum inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors and ryanodine receptors in the mechanism of intracellular calcium wave propagation in human uterine myocytes. A secondary goal was to identify the rate-determining step of calcium wave propagation. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant human myometrium was obtained at the time of cesarean delivery, enzymatically dispersed, and cultured through several passages. Intracellular calcium wave velocities were measured with video fluorescence microscopy and the calcium-dependent fluorescent dye calcium green 1. Experimental conditions were modified by exposure of the cells to ruthenium red (blocked ryanodine receptor), ryanodine (locked open ryanodine receptor), oxytocin (increased inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate), sodium butyrate (intracellular acidification), ammonium chloride (intracellular alkalinization), and elevation of temperature (from 19 degrees C to 30 degrees C). RESULTS: Wave velocities were found to be the same for spontaneously occurring (9.6 +/- 2.6 microm/s) and oxytocin-stimulated (10.3 +/- 3.4 microm/s) waves. Advance treatment of the cells with ryanodine or ruthenium red failed to change oxytocin-stimulated wave velocities from control values. The temperature dependence of calcium wave velocities was studied across the range 19 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Plots of wave velocities versus the inverse of the temperature yielded apparent activation energies that were the same for spontaneous (13.2 +/- 0.3 kcal/mol) and oxytocin-induced (14.3 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol) waves. After intracellular acidification by treatment with butyrate (20 mmol/L) wave velocities increased by 44%. Wave velocities decreased by 35% after treatment with ammonium chloride (20 mmol/L). CONCLUSION: Propagation of intracellular calcium waves in cultured human uterine myocytes exhibited mechanisms of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release that could use either inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors alone or ryanodine receptors alone, or both together. The rate-determining step for calcium wave propagation was diffusion of calcium though a highly buffered cytoplasm.},

	Abstract = {Darier&apos;s disease (DD) is a high penetrance, autosomal dominant mutation in the ATP2A2 gene, which encodes the SERCA2 Ca2+ pump. Here we have used a mouse model of DD, a SERCA2(+/-) mouse, to define the adaptation of Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis to a deletion of one copy of the SERCA2 gene. The [Ca2+]i transient evoked by maximal agonist stimulation was shorter in cells from SERCA2(+/-) mice, due to an up-regulation of specific plasma membrane Ca2+ pump isoforms. The change in cellular Ca2+ handling caused approximately 50% reduction in [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency. Nonetheless, agonist-stimulated exocytosis was identical in cells from wild-type and SERCA2(+/-) mice. This was due to adaptation in the levels of the Ca2+ sensors for exocytosis synaptotagmins I and III in cells from SERCA2(+/-) mice. Accordingly, exocytosis was approximately 10-fold more sensitive to Ca2+ in cells from SERCA2(+/-) mice. These findings reveal a remarkable plasticity and adaptability of Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+-dependent cellular functions in vivo, and can explain the normal function of most physiological systems in DD patients.},

	Abstract = {Rapid inactivation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels was studied in Jurkat leukemic T lymphocytes using whole-cell patch clamp recording and [Ca2+]i measurement techniques. In the presence of 22 mM extracellular Ca2+, the Ca2+ current declined with a biexponential time course (time constants of 8-30 ms and 50-150 ms) during hyperpolarizing pulses to potentials more negative than -40 mV. Several lines of evidence suggest that the fast inactivation process is Ca2+ but not voltage dependent. First, the speed and extent of inactivation are enhanced by conditions that increase the rate of Ca2+ entry through open channels. Second, inactivation is substantially reduced when Ba2+ is present as the charge carrier. Third, inactivation is slowed by intracellular dialysis with BAPTA (12 mM), a rapid Ca2+ buffer, but not by raising the cytoplasmic concentration of EGTA, a slower chelator, from 1.2 to 12 mM. Recovery from fast inactivation is complete within 200 ms after repolarization to -12 mV. Rapid inactivation is unaffected by changes in the number of open CRAC channels or global [Ca2+]i. These results demonstrate that rapid inactivation of ICRAC results from the action of Ca2+ in close proximity to the intracellular mouths of individual channels, and that Ca2+ entry through one CRAC channel does not affect neighboring channels. A simple model for Ca2+ diffusion in the presence of a mobile buffer predicts multiple Ca2+ inactivation sites situated 3-4 nm from the intracellular mouth of the pore, consistent with a location on the CRAC channel itself.},

	Abstract = {Feedback regulation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels was studied in Jurkat leukemic T lymphocytes using whole cell recording and [Ca2+]i measurement techniques. CRAC channels were activated by passively depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under conditions of moderate intracellular Ca2+ buffering, elevating [Ca2+]o to 22 mM initiated an inward current through CRAC channels that declined slowly with a half-time of approximately 30 s. This slow inactivation was evoked by a rise in [Ca2+]i, as it was effectively suppressed by an elevated level of EFTA in the recording pipette that prevented increases in [Ca2+]i. Blockade of Ca2+ uptake into stores by thapsigargin with or without intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate reduced the extent of slow inactivation by approximately 50%, indicating that store refilling normally contributes significantly to this process. The store-independent (thapsigargin-insensitive) portion of slow inactivation was largely prevented by the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, and by a structurally related compound, 1-norokadaone, but not by calyculin A nor by cyclosporin A and FK506 at concentrations that fully inhibit calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) in T cells. These results argue against the involvement of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, 2B, or 3 in store-independent inactivation. We conclude that calcium acts through at least two slow negative feedback pathways to inhibit CRAC channels. Slow feedback inhibition of CRAC current is likely to play important roles in controlling the duration and dynamic behavior of receptor-generated Ca2+ signals.},
